# Connect Snowflake to Fusion [Preview](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")

Local development

Snowflake enforcing strong authentication

Starting August 31, 2026, password authentication will no longer be supported. Please update your environments to use key-pair or OAuth by that date to prevent service disruptions.

You can configure the Snowflake adapter by running `dbt init` in your CLI or manually providing the `profiles.yml` file with the fields configured for your authentication type. To check out which Snowflake functions are supported in Fusion in `strict` mode, refer to [Snowflake function support](../../../reference/resource-configs/snowflake-function-support.md).

The Snowflake adapter for Fusion supports the following [authentication methods](#supported-authentication-types):

* Password
* Key pair
* Single sign-on (SSO)
* Password with MFA

note

[Snowflake is deprecating single-access password login](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-mfa-rollout). Individual developers should use MFA or SSO instead of password authentication. Password-based login remains supported for service users (Snowflake user type: `LEGACY_SERVICE`).

## Warehouse permissions

The Snowflake user or service account that dbt Fusion engine connects as must be able to run dbt workloads (queries, metadata, and typical materializations). Grant privileges through a Snowflake role assigned to that user.

### Required Snowflake objects

Before connecting, these objects must exist:

| Object        | Purpose                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Account**   | Your Snowflake account identifier                  |
| **User**      | Service account or user for Fusion                 |
| **Role**      | Role assigned to the user with required privileges |
| **Warehouse** | Virtual warehouse for compute                      |
| **Database**  | Target database or databases for dbt models        |
| **Schema**    | Target schema or schemas within the database       |

### Core operations

The following are required permissions for fundamental dbt operations:

| Permission     | Object          | Purpose                                    |

| `TRUNCATE`     | Tables          | Full refresh of incremental models         |
| `DROP`         | Tables or views | Replace existing objects                   |

### Metadata operations

The following are required permissions for dbt metadata operations:

| Permission            | Object              | Purpose                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |

| `EXECUTE TASK`       | Schema | Snowflake tasks                     |

For role examples and SQL grants in Snowflake, you can also refer to [Snowflake permissions](../../../reference/database-permissions/snowflake-permissions.md).

## Snowflake configuration details

The information required for configuring the Snowflake adapter can be found conveniently in your Snowflake account menu:

1. Click on your name from the Snowflake sidebar.
2. Hover over the **Account** field.
3. In the field with your account name, click **View account details**.
4. Click **Config file** and select the appropriate **Warehouse** and **Database**.

[![Sample config file in Snowflake.](/img/fusion/connect-adapters/snowflake-account-details.png?v=2 "Sample config file in Snowflake.")](#)Sample config file in Snowflake.

## Configure Fusion

Executing `dbt init` in your CLI will prompt for the following fields:

* **Account:** Snowflake account number
* **User:** Your Snowflake username
* **Database:** The database within your Snowflake account to connect to your project
* **Warehouse:** The compute warehouse that will handle the tasks for your project
* **Schema:** The development/staging/deployment schema for the project
* **Role (Optional):** The role dbt should assume when connnecting to the warehouse

Alternatively, you can manually create the `profiles.yml` file and configure the fields. See examples in [authentication](#supported-authentication-types) section for formatting. If there is an existing `profiles.yml` file, you are given the option to retain the existing fields or overwrite them.

Next, select your authentication method. Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the required information.

## Supported authentication types

### Password

Password authentication prompts for your Snowflake account password. This is becoming an increasingly less common option as organizations opt for more secure authentication.

Selecting **Password with MFA** redirects you to the Snowflake account login to provide your passkey or authenticator password.

#### Example password configuration

profiles.yml

```yml
default:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      threads: 16
      account: ABC123
      user: JANE.SMITH@YOURCOMPANY.COM
      database: JAFFLE_SHOP
      warehouse: TRANSFORM
      schema: JANE_SMITH
      password: THISISMYPASSWORD
```

#### Example password with MFA configuration

profiles.yml

```yml
default:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      threads: 16
      authenticator: username_password_mfa
      account: ABC123
      user: JANE.SMITH@YOURCOMPANY.COM
      database: JAFFLE_SHOP
      warehouse: TRANFORM
      schema: JANE_SMITH
```

### Key pair

Key pair authentication gives you the option to:

* Define the path to the key.
* Provide the plain-text PEM format key inline.

We recommend using PKCS#8 format with AES-256 encryption for key pair authentication with Fusion. Fusion doesn't support legacy 3DES encryption or headerless key formats. Using older key formats may cause authentication failures.

If you encounter the `Key is PKCS#1 (RSA private key). Snowflake requires PKCS#8` error, then your private key is in the wrong format. You have two options:

* (Recommended fix) Re-export your key with modern encryption:

  ```bash
  # Convert to PKCS#8 with AES-256 encryption
  openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v2 aes-256-cbc -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8
  ```

* (Temporary workaround) Add the `BEGIN` header and `END` footer to your PEM body:

  ```text
  -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
  < Your existing encrypted private key contents >
  -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

Once the key is configuted, you will be given the option to provide a passphrase, if required.

#### Example key pair configuration

profiles.yml

```yml
default:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      threads: 16
      account: ABC123
      user: JANE.SMITH@YOURCOMPANY.COM
      database: JAFFLE_SHOP
      warehouse: TRANSFORM
      schema: JANE_SMITH
      private_key: '<Your existing encrypted private key contents>'
      private_key_passphrase: YOURPASSPHRASEHERE
```

### Single sign-on

Single sign-on will leverage your browser to authenticate the Snowflake session.

By default, every connection that dbt opens will require you to re-authenticate in a browser. The Snowflake connector package supports caching your session token, but it [currently only supports Windows and Mac OS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-fed-auth-use.html#optional-using-connection-caching-to-minimize-the-number-of-prompts-for-authentication).

Refer to the [Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters.html#label-allow-id-token) for information on enabling this feature in your account.

#### Example SSO configuration

profiles.yml

```yml
default:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      threads: 16
      authenticator: externalbrowser
      account: ABC123
      user: JANE.SMITH@YOURCOMPANY.COM
      database: JAFFLE_SHOP
      warehouse: TRANSFORM
      schema: JANE_SMITH
```
