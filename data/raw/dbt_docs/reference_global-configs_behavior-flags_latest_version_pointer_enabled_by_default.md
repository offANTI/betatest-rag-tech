The `latest_version_pointer_enabled_by_default` flag is set to `false` by default in dbt Core v1.x. In Fusion, this flag defaults to `true`, which enables the latest version pointer for all versioned models automatically.

When you set it to `true`, dbt automatically creates a [latest version pointer](../../../docs/mesh/govern/model-versions.md#pointing-to-the-latest-version) view for every versioned model in the project, without requiring per-model configuration. The pointer view is named after the model's base name (for example, `dim_customers`) and always points to the relation for the model with `is_latest_version: true` (for example, `dim_customers_v2`).

Without this flag, you must opt in per model by setting [`latest_version_pointer.enabled: true`](../../resource-configs/latest_version_pointer.md) in the model config.
