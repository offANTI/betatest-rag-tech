# YAML Selectors

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

Write resource selectors in YAML, save them with a human-friendly name, and reference them using the `selector:` method with `--select`.

By recording selectors in a top-level `selectors.yml` file:

* **Legibility:** complex selection criteria are composed of dictionaries and arrays
* **Version control:** selector definitions are stored in the same git repository as the dbt project
* **Reusability:** selectors can be referenced in multiple job definitions, and their definitions are extensible (via YAML anchors)

Selectors live in a top-level file named `selectors.yml`. Each must have a `name` and a `definition`, and can optionally define a `description` and [`default` flag](#default).

selectors.yml

```yml
selectors:
  - name: nodes_to_joy
    definition: ...
  - name: nodes_to_a_grecian_urn
    description: Attic shape with a fair attitude
    default: true
    definition: ...
```

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

Starting in dbt Core v1.12, you can reference a named selector from `--select` or `--exclude` using the [`selector` method](./methods.md#selector) (for example, `selector:my_selector`).

## Definitions

Each `definition` is comprised of one or more arguments, which can be one of the following:

* **CLI-style:** strings, representing CLI-style arguments
* **Key-value:** pairs in the form `method: value`
* **Full YAML:** fully specified dictionaries with items for `method`, `value`, operator-equivalent keywords, and support for `exclude`

Use the `union` and `intersection` operator-equivalent keywords to organize multiple arguments.

### CLI-style

```yml
definition:
  'tag:nightly'
```

This simple syntax supports use of the `+`, `@`, and `*` [graph](./graph-operators.md) operators, [set](./set-operators.md) operators, and `exclude`.

### Key-value

```yml
definition:
  tag: nightly
```

This simple syntax does not support any [graph](./graph-operators.md) or [set](./set-operators.md) operators or `exclude`.

### Full YAML

This is the most thorough syntax, which can include the operator-equivalent keywords for [graph](./graph-operators.md) and [set](./set-operators.md) operators.

Review [methods](./methods.md) for the available list.

```yml
definition:
  method: tag
  value: nightly

  # Optional keywords map to the `+` and `@` graph operators:

  children: true | false
  parents: true | false

  children_depth: 1    # if children: true, degrees to include
  parents_depth: 1     # if parents: true, degrees to include

  childrens_parents: true | false     # @ operator

  indirect_selection: eager | cautious | buildable | empty # include all tests selected indirectly? eager by default
```

The `*` operator to select all nodes can be written as:

```yml
definition:
  method: fqn
  value: "*"
```

#### Exclude

The `exclude` keyword is only supported by fully-qualified dictionaries. It may be passed as an argument to each dictionary, or as an item in a `union`. The following are equivalent:

```yml
- method: tag
  value: nightly
  exclude:
    - "@tag:daily"
```

```yml
- union:
    - method: tag
      value: nightly
    - exclude:
       - method: tag
         value: daily
```

Note: The `exclude` argument in YAML selectors is subtly different from the `--exclude` CLI argument. Here, `exclude` *always* returns a [set difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_\(set_theory\)), and it is always applied *last* within its scope.

When more than one "yeslist" (`--select`) is passed, they are treated as a [union](./set-operators.md#unions) rather than an [intersection](./set-operators.md#intersections). Same thing when there is more than one "nolist" (`--exclude`).

#### Indirect selection

As a general rule, dbt will indirectly select *all* tests if they touch *any* resource that you're selecting directly. We call this "eager" indirect selection. You can optionally switch the indirect selection mode to "cautious", "buildable", or "empty" by setting `indirect_selection` for a specific criterion:

```yml
- union:
    - method: fqn
      value: model_a
      indirect_selection: eager  # default: will include all tests that touch model_a
    - method: fqn
      value: model_b
      indirect_selection: cautious  # will not include tests touching model_b
                        # if they have other unselected parents
    - method: fqn
      value: model_c
      indirect_selection: buildable  # will not include tests touching model_c
                        # if they have other unselected parents (unless they have an ancestor that is selected)
    - method: fqn
      value: model_d
      indirect_selection: empty  # will include tests for only the selected node and ignore all tests attached to model_d
```

If provided, a YAML selector's `indirect_selection` value will take precedence over the CLI flag `--indirect-selection`. Because `indirect_selection` is defined separately for *each* selection criterion, it's possible to mix eager/cautious/buildable/empty modes within the same definition, to achieve the exact behavior that you need. (Applies to dbt v1.12 and later) You can always test out your criteria with `dbt ls --select selector:SELECTOR_NAME`.

See [test selection examples](./test-selection-examples.md) for more details about indirect selection.

## Example

Here are two ways to represent:

```bash
$ dbt run --select @source:snowplow,tag:nightly models/export --exclude package:snowplow,config.materialized:incremental export_performance_timing
```

### CLI-style

selectors.yml

```yml

selectors:
  - name: nightly_diet_snowplow
    description: "Non-incremental Snowplow models that power nightly exports"
    definition:

      # Optional `union` and `intersection` keywords map to the ` ` and `,` set operators:
      union:
        - intersection:
            - '@source:snowplow'
            - 'tag:nightly'
        - 'models/export'
        - exclude:
            - intersection:
                - 'package:snowplow'
                - 'config.materialized:incremental'
            - export_performance_timing
```

### Full YML

selectors.yml

```yml
selectors:
  - name: nightly_diet_snowplow
    description: "Non-incremental Snowplow models that power nightly exports"
    definition:
      # Optional `union` and `intersection` keywords map to the ` ` and `,` set operators:
      union:
        - intersection:
            - method: source
              value: snowplow
              childrens_parents: true
            - method: tag
              value: nightly
        - method: path
          value: models/export
        - exclude:
            - intersection:
                - method: package
                  value: snowplow
                - method: config.materialized
                  value: incremental
            - method: fqn
              value: export_performance_timing
```

Then in our job definition:

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

```bash
dbt run --select selector:nightly_diet_snowplow
```

## Default

Selectors may define a boolean `default` property. If a selector has `default: true`, dbt will use this selector's criteria when tasks do not define their own selection criteria.

Let's say we define a default selector that only selects resources defined in our root project:

```yml
selectors:
  - name: root_project_only
    description: >
        Only resources from the root project.
        Excludes resources defined in installed packages.
    default: true
    definition:
      method: package
      value: <my_root_project_name>
```

If I run an "unqualified" command, dbt will use the selection criteria defined in `root_project_only`—that is, dbt will only build / freshness check / generate compiled SQL for resources defined in my root project.

```text
dbt build
dbt source freshness
dbt docs generate
```

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

If I run a command that defines its own selection criteria (through `--select` or `--exclude`), dbt will ignore the default selector and use the flag criteria instead. It will not try to combine the two.

If you want to apply both, use the `selector:` method with `--select` to reference the default selector alongside other criteria. For example:

```text
dbt build --select selector:root_project_only tag:nightly
```

For more information, refer to [Using `selector:` with `--select`](#using-selector-with---select).

Only one selector may set `default: true` for a given invocation; otherwise, dbt will return an error. You may use a Jinja expression to adjust the value of `default` depending on the environment, however:

```yml
selectors:
  - name: default_for_dev
    default: "{{ target.name == 'dev' | as_bool }}"
    definition: ...
  - name: default_for_prod
    default: "{{ target.name == 'prod' | as_bool }}"
    definition: ...
```

### Selector inheritance

Selectors can reuse and extend definitions from other selectors, via the `selector` method.

```yml
selectors:
  - name: foo_and_bar
    definition:
      intersection:
        - tag: foo
        - tag: bar

  - name: foo_bar_less_buzz
    definition:
      intersection:
        # reuse the definition from above
        - method: selector
          value: foo_and_bar
        # with a modification!
        - exclude:
            - method: tag
              value: buzz
```

**Note:** While selector inheritance allows the logic from another selector to be *reused*, it doesn't allow the logic from that selector to be *modified* by means of `parents`, `children`, `indirect_selection`, and so on.

The `selector` method returns the complete set of nodes returned by the named selector.

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

If selector definitions reference each other in a cycle, dbt raises `DbtRecursionError` at runtime. For example, the following selector inheritance is invalid:

```yaml
selectors:
  - name: selector_a
    definition:
      method: selector
      value: selector_b

  - name: selector_b
    definition:
      method: selector
      value: selector_a
```

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

## Using `selector:` with `--select`

Starting in dbt Core v1.12, dbt raises `SelectExcludeIgnoredWithSelectorWarning` when the legacy `--selector` flag is combined with `--select` or `--exclude`. Use the [`selector:` method](./methods.md#selector) directly with `--select` to reference a predefined selector alongside other selection criteria.

For example:

```text
dbt run --select selector:nightly_diet_snowplow tag:nightly
```
