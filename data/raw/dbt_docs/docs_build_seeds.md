## Overview

Seeds are CSV files in your dbt project (typically in your `seeds` directory), that dbt can load into your data warehouse using the `dbt seed` command.

Seeds can be referenced in downstream models the same way as referencing models — by using the [`ref` function](../../reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref.md).

Because these CSV files are located in your dbt repository, they are version controlled and code reviewable. Seeds are best suited to static data which changes infrequently.

Good use-cases for seeds:

* A list of mappings of country codes to country names
* A list of test emails to exclude from analysis
* A list of employee account IDs

Poor use-cases of dbt seeds:

* Loading raw data that has been exported to CSVs
* Any kind of production data containing sensitive information. For example personal identifiable information (PII) and passwords.

## Example

To load a seed file in your dbt project:

1. Add the file to your `seeds` directory, with a `.csv` file extension, for example, `seeds/country_codes.csv`

seeds/country\_codes.csv

```text
country_code,country_name
US,United States
CA,Canada
GB,United Kingdom
...
```

2. Run the `dbt seed` [command](../../reference/commands/seed.md) — a new table will be created in your warehouse in your target schema, named `country_codes`

```text
$ dbt seed

Found 2 models, 3 tests, 0 archives, 0 analyses, 53 macros, 0 operations, 1 seed file

14:46:15 | Concurrency: 1 threads (target='dev')
14:46:15 |
14:46:15 | 1 of 1 START seed file analytics.country_codes........................... [RUN]
14:46:15 | 1 of 1 OK loaded seed file analytics.country_codes....................... [INSERT 3 in 0.01s]
14:46:16 |
14:46:16 | Finished running 1 seed in 0.14s.

Completed successfully

Done. PASS=1 ERROR=0 SKIP=0 TOTAL=1
```

3. Refer to seeds in downstream models using the `ref` function.

models/orders.sql

```sql
-- This refers to the table created from seeds/country_codes.csv
select * from {{ ref('country_codes') }}
```

## Configuring seeds

Seeds are configured in your `dbt_project.yml`, check out the [seed configurations](../../reference/seed-configs.md) docs for a full list of available configurations.

## Documenting and testing seeds

You can document and test seeds in YAML by declaring properties — check out the docs on [seed properties](../../reference/seed-properties.md) for more information.

## FAQs

Can I use seeds to load raw data?

Seeds should **not** be used to load raw data (for example, large CSV exports from a production database).

Since seeds are version controlled, they are best suited to files that contain business-specific logic, for example a list of country codes or user IDs of employees.

Loading CSVs using dbt's seed functionality is not performant for large files. Consider using a different tool to load these CSVs into your data warehouse.

Can I store my seeds in a directory other than the \`seeds\` directory in my project?

By default, dbt expects your seed files to be located in the `seeds` subdirectory of your project.

To change this, update the [seed-paths](../../reference/project-configs/seed-paths.md) configuration in your `dbt_project.yml` file, like so:

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
seed-paths: ["custom_seeds"]
```

The columns of my seed changed, and now I get an error when running the \`seed\` command, what should I do?

If you changed the columns of your seed, you may get a `Database Error`:

### Snowflake

Completed with 1 error and 0 warnings:

Database Error in seed country_codes (seeds/country_codes.csv)
  column "country_name" of relation "country_codes" does not exist

Done. PASS=0 WARN=0 ERROR=1 SKIP=0 TOTAL=1
```

In this case, you should rerun the command with a `--full-refresh` flag, like so:

```text
dbt seed --full-refresh
```

**Why is this the case?**

When you typically run dbt seed, dbt truncates the existing table and reinserts the data. This pattern avoids a `drop cascade` command, which may cause downstream objects (that your BI users might be querying!) to get dropped.

However, when column names are changed, or new columns are added, these statements will fail as the table structure has changed.

The `--full-refresh` flag will force dbt to `drop cascade` the existing table before rebuilding it.

How do I test and document seeds?

To test and document seeds, use a [properties file](../../reference/configs-and-properties.md) and nest the configurations under a `seeds:` key

## Example

seeds/properties.yml

```yml
seeds:
  - name: country_codes
    description: A mapping of two letter country codes to country names
    columns:
      - name: country_code
        data_tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: country_name
        data_tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
```

How do I set a datatype for a column in my seed?

dbt will infer the datatype for each column based on the data in your CSV.

You can also explicitly set a datatype using the `column_types` [configuration](../../reference/resource-configs/column_types.md) like so:

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
seeds:
  jaffle_shop: # you must include the project name
    warehouse_locations:
      +column_types:
        zipcode: varchar(5)
```

How do I run models downstream of a seed?

You can run models downstream of a seed using the [model selection syntax](../../reference/node-selection/syntax.md), and treating the seed like a model.

For example, the following would run all models downstream of a seed named `country_codes`:

```shell
$ dbt run --select country_codes+
```

How do I preserve leading zeros in a seed?

If you need to preserve leading zeros (for example in a zipcode or mobile number), include leading zeros in your seed file, and use the `column_types` [configuration](../../reference/resource-configs/column_types.md) with a varchar datatype of the correct length.

How do I build one seed at a time?

You can use a `--select` option with the `dbt seed` command, like so:

```shell

$ dbt seed --select country_codes
```

There is also an `--exclude` option.

Check out more in the [model selection syntax](../../reference/node-selection/syntax.md) documentation.

Do hooks run with seeds?

Yes! The following hooks are available:

* [pre-hooks & post-hooks](../../reference/resource-configs/pre-hook-post-hook.md)
* [on-run-start & on-run-end hooks](../../reference/project-configs/on-run-start-on-run-end.md)

Configure these in your `dbt_project.yml` file.
