# dbt Wizard in Studio IDE [Preview](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")

dbt platform | Usage-based

Use dbt Wizard in the Studio IDE to ship trusted dbt changes faster. It understands your project, answers context-grounded questions, generates models, tests, docs, and Semantic Layer definitions, and shows file diffs before changes are persisted.

dbt Wizard supports the dbt development lifecycle from investigation to review. Use it to:

* Ask project-aware questions using lineage, metadata, and catalog context.
* Build or refactor models from natural-language prompts.
* Generate and validate YAML for tests, documentation, semantic models, and metrics.
* Make scoped edits to logic, names, materializations, tests, and related YAML.
* Investigate job and run failures with dbt Agent Skills.

The agent comes with the following out of the box, meaning no configuration needed:

* [dbt Agent Skills](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills): dbt-recommended guidance and instructions, managed by dbt Labs.
* [dbt MCP server Product docs toolset](./mcp-available-tools.md#product-docs): Tools for searching and fetching content from dbt's official documentation.

AI features are being enabled by default. They're already on for new accounts and are rolling out soon to existing accounts. If your organization opted out, they'll remain off. Admins can [turn AI off or back on and configure providers](../platform/manage-dbt-ai.md) anytime.

### Prerequisites

* A [dbt platform account](https://www.getdbt.com/signup) and [Developer seat license](../platform/manage-access/seats-and-users.md).
  * [Legacy Team plans](../platform/billing/plans-and-billing.md#legacy-plans) don't have access to dbt Wizard. Move to a [Starter, Enterprise, or Enterprise+ plan](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing) to use it.
* A [development environment](../platform/studio-ide/develop-in-studio.md#get-started-with-the-studio-ide) and credentials set up in the Studio IDE.
* Use a supported AI provider. Refer to [Supported AI providers](../platform/wizard-platform.md#supported-ai-providers), or the [Model Provider Rate Table](https://www.getdbt.com/legal/dbt-wizard-token-costs-by-model) for the full model list and rates.

If dbt Wizard stops responding, your account may have used up its usage credits. Refer to [Trial and billing](./pricing-billing/trial-and-billing.md).

 Availability and considerations

* **Where it runs:** Supported in the [Studio IDE](../platform/studio-ide/develop-in-studio.md) only, all [deployment types](../platform/about-platform/tenancy.md?version=2.0). Not supported in VS Code or the dbt platform CLI.
* **Engines:** Works with dbt Fusion engine and dbt Core.
* **Conversations:** In the conversation list, open **More actions** menu (three dots) of the conversation you want to delete, then click **Delete** to remove one thread. Deleting the open thread clears the panel.
* **Sessions:** Refreshing the same browser tab keeps your active session. A new tab, or returning after closing the tab, starts empty.
* **Chat history:** Retained for 90 days only. Chat history isn't supported yet on single-tenant deployments, so save anything important before closing.
* **Plan mode:** Not supported yet. The agent doesn't show a separate plan before applying changes, however you can use the **Ask for approval** mode to approve each file.
* **New chat:** Click **Start new dbt Wizard chat** (top right of the dbt Wizard panel) to begin a new session.

### Using dbt Wizard

Use the dbt Wizard panel to generate resources with quick actions, or use the agent to build and refactor models end-to-end with natural language prompts.

To use the dbt Wizard, follow these steps:

1. Open your dbt project in the [Studio IDE](../platform/studio-ide/develop-in-studio.md), then click **dbt Wizard** in the command palette.

2. Start a prompt in several ways in the [dbt Wizard panel](./wizard-ide.md?version=2#panel-controls):

   * **Quick actions**: Use [quick-action resource generation](./wizard-ide.md#quick-action-resource-generation) at the top of the panel for quick action prompts.
   * **Plain text**: Type directly into the text field to describe what you want to build or change.
   * **Model context**: Type `@` to select a model as context. This scopes the agent's changes to that resource.

3. Select the [**Agent mode** button](./wizard-ide.md#agent-modes) to specify the mode for the dbt Wizard. Available modes are **Explore only**, **Ask for approval** (default), and **Edit files automatically**.

4. Select the dbt managed model you'd like to work with from the [model picker](./pricing-billing/overview.md#choose-a-model) next to the **Agent mode** button.

5. [Review the agent's suggestions](./wizard-ide.md#reviewing-agent-suggestions) and approve or reject the changes. You can also use the **Start new dbt Wizard chat** button to start a new chat session.

6. [Approve dbt commands](./wizard-ide.md#granting-command-permissions) when the dbt Wizard requests to run commands like `dbt compile` or `dbt build`.

7. Repeat the process to build or change more models.

8. Commit the changes to your dbt project and open a pull request.

The following images show how dbt Wizard displays its work and outcome:

 Panel controls

The dbt Wizard panel contains:

1. **Quick actions** (center): Buttons at the top of the panel for common tasks like generating documentation, tests, semantic models, and metrics. When selected, the text field is pre-filled with a prompt.
2. **Agent mode button** (bottom left): Switch between **Explore only**, **Ask for approval**, and **Edit files automatically** mode. Click the button to change modes.
3. **Model picker** (bottom left): Select the dbt managed model to use for the session. Refer to [Choose a model](#choose-a-model) for the available models.
4. **dbt model context** (bottom left): Shows the currently open file. Use `@` in the text field to reference a different dbt model. Click **x** to remove the dbt model context.
5. **Text input field** (bottom left): Type your prompt in the text field to describe what you want to build or change. Type `@` to select a dbt model as context. This scopes the agent's changes to that resource.
6. **Start new dbt Wizard chat** (top right): Starts a new chat session.
7. **Stop** or **Enter** (bottom right): Press **Enter** to submit your prompt. Press **Stop** to stop the current session and agent processing. You cannot undo this action.

 Agent modes

The dbt Wizard operates in three modes:

| Mode                           | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explore only**               | The agent queries and explains data but can't edit files or run builds. Best when you want to analyze data or validate a model's output without the agent proposing changes. Every answer comes with the SQL or metric definition behind it. Available for read-only users in the home tab. |
| **Ask for approval** (default) | The agent drafts edits to files. You approve each file change before it is persisted. Best when you want tight control over what gets saved to your branch.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Edit files automatically**   | The agent drafts and automatically saves file edits without per-file approval. Best for faster iteration when you're confident in the prompt.                                                                                                                                               |

Switch between modes anytime with the **Agent mode** button (bottom-left). The authoring modes keep the analytical tools available, so switching out of **Explore only** doesn't cost you anything.

[![dbt Wizard in Explore only, Ask for approval, and Edit files automatically modes.](/img/docs/dbt-platform/wizard-modes.png?v=2 "dbt Wizard in Explore only, Ask for approval, and Edit files automatically modes.")](#)dbt Wizard in Explore only, Ask for approval, and Edit files automatically modes.

 Reviewing agent suggestions

When the dbt Wizard proposes code changes, you can review them before they are saved to your project:

* **View the diff**: The agent displays a diff of the proposed changes. Click **Show all X lines** to expand and view the full suggestion.
* **Line indicators**: Added and removed lines are highlighted with line number indicators so you can see exactly what changed.
* **Copy or open in editor**: Use the options in the top-right corner of the diff view to copy the suggestion or open it directly in the editor.

 Granting command permissions

To validate or run models during a session, the agent may request to run dbt commands such as `dbt compile` or `dbt build`. You'll be prompted to approve each request before it executes. For example, the agent might request to run:

```bash
dbt compile --select model_name
```

You can select one of the following options:

| Option                                                | Behavior                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Yes, run once**                                     | Grants permission to run this specific command one time.                                         |
| **Yes, and allow `dbt_command_name` for the session** | Grants permission to run dbt commands for the remainder of your session without prompting again. |
| **No**                                                | Denies the request. The agent will not run the command.                                          |

After you run a command, dbt Wizard adds an icon and a tooltip to the Studio IDE [**Commands** tab](../platform/studio-ide/ide-user-interface.md#console-section) results. This helps you distinguish agent-run commands from manually run commands in the run results and logs.

### Bringing your own skills

You can extend dbt Wizard with custom skills to encode your team's SQL conventions, naming rules, and modeling workflows — so you don't repeat them in every prompt. See [Skills](./wizard-platform-skills.md) for the full reference, including how to create, structure, and invoke skills.

### Debug job failures

The dbt Wizard can investigate and troubleshoot dbt job and run failures directly from the Studio IDE. This capability is powered by the `troubleshooting-dbt-job-errors` [dbt Agent Skill](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills), which comes pre-configured with the agent — no setup required.

You can ask the agent questions and issue commands like:

* "What jobs have failed recently?"
* "What is the root cause of the job failure?"
* "How can I fix the recent job failure?"
* "Fix the job failure."

The agent notes when your local project state may differ from the job — for example, if you're on a different branch or have uncommitted changes — so you have full context before acting on any suggested fixes.

### Timeout handling

When a dbt command run by dbt Wizard runs for more than 5 minutes, the agent automatically attempts to stop the command on the server before returning control to you.

Instead of hanging or showing a generic error, the agent returns a clear message that explains the command timed out and was aborted. The message also tells you whether the cancellation request succeeded. If cancellation fails, it's possible the command may still be running on the server.

You can then choose whether to retry the command, narrow the request, or take another action.

### Fusion migration workflow

If you have access to [dbt Wizard](./wizard-ide.md) with [AI features](../platform/manage-dbt-ai.md) enabled, you can use the [Fusion migration workflow](./wizard-ide.md#fusion-migration-workflow) skill. This skill can help you fix compatibility errors directly from the Studio IDE using dbt Wizard — no manual log investigation needed. It classifies every error, applies validated fixes automatically, and surfaces what's blocked.

info

The Fusion migration workflow is accessible through the dbt Wizard in the Studio IDE. If you're using VS Code or the dbt platform CLI, use the [autofix tool](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/dbt-package-compat?step=4) instead.

1. From the job list, click the **Review job** button for a job with a successful run.
   * If you don't see the **Review job** button, enable the **Show Fusion eligibility** toggle in the job list.

2. In the **Fusion eligibility unknown for this job** pop-up, click **Debug in Studio with dbt Wizard**.

3. dbt redirects you to the Studio IDE and sets your personal development environment to Fusion.

4. dbt Wizard opens and automatically triggers the Fusion migration skill with this prompt:

   ```text
   I need help fixing Fusion compatibility issues in this project. Please investigate and resolve any deprecation warnings or incompatibilities. Please use the migrating-dbt-core-to-fusion skill to guide this.
   ```

5. Review and approve dbt Wizard's permission requests so it can run the commands it needs.

6. The dbt Wizard iteratively runs `dbt compile`, reads the results, and applies fixes until it reaches a successful compile or encounters an error it can't resolve. If it gets blocked, it exits cleanly, explains what it could not fix, and creates and links to a markdown file summarizing all changes made.

7. When the project compiles with no warnings or errors, commit and publish your changes.

8. After you merge the changes, wait for the job to run again or run it manually on Fusion.

For more on how to prepare your project for Fusion and what to do when you hit compatibility errors, see the [dbt v2 readiness checklist](../dbt/dbt-readiness.md) and the [Upgrade to Fusion guides](../../guides/prepare-dbt-upgrade.md).

### Writing effective prompts

Good prompts include the *scope* (which models or area of the project), the *intent* (the transformation or business logic you want), and any *constraints* (naming conventions, materialization, tests). Here are a few examples:

| Task                       | Example prompt                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build a new model          | "Create a model called `fct_daily_revenue` that joins `stg_orders` and `stg_payments`, aggregates revenue by day, and materializes as a table." |
| Refactor an existing model | "Refactor `fct_orders` to use incremental materialization. Keep existing tests and follow our naming conventions."                              |
| Generate tests and docs    | "Add `not_null` and `unique` tests to the primary key of `dim_customers`, and generate documentation for all columns."                          |

For detailed guidance, patterns, and more examples across SQL, documentation, tests, and semantic models, see the [Prompt cookbook](../../guides/prompt-cookbook.md).

Best practices for using dbt Wizard

For recommended workflows on real project tasks — understanding a project, validating changes, building Semantic Layer definitions, and more — refer to [How to use dbt Wizard in your dbt project](../../best-practices/how-to-use-wizard/wizard-1-intro.md). Most of these prompts work the same in Studio IDE.

## Ask questions in Explore mode

Explore mode in Studio IDE lets you ask questions of your production data in plain language. dbt Wizard in Explore mode answers and explains but never changes your project. This option is great for exploratory data analysis and getting a quick understanding of your data.

Explore mode queries with your personal warehouse credentials.

1. Open dbt Wizard and set the mode picker (bottom-left) to **Explore only** if needed.

2. Type your question and press **Enter**. Make sure you're specific and include the time period, grouping, and filter you care about:

   * `what was total revenue in Q2 2026, by month?`
   * `how many new customers signed up in July?`
   * `which regions grew fastest this year?`

3. dbt Wizard gives a plain-language summary of what it did, then the result. Switch between **Chart**, **Table**, and **SQL** to see the data your way.

4. Validate the data by using the **SQL** view to review the query or governed metric behind the answer. Note that you can't edit the SQL query but you can copy it.

5. Keep going by asking a follow-up in the same conversation. For example, `now break that out by region` works after your first question.

Explore mode uses dbt-managed inference, so questions draw from your account's dbt Wizard [consumption pool](./wizard-billing-faqs.md) like any other dbt Wizard usage.

In the Studio IDE, the answer and its visualization appear inline in the dbt Wizard panel alongside your project.

[![Explore mode in the Studio IDE, showing a chart and Chart/Table/SQL toggles in the dbt Wizard panel.](/img/docs/dbt-platform/wizard-ide-explore-viz.png?v=2 "Explore mode in the Studio IDE, showing a chart and Chart/Table/SQL toggles in the dbt Wizard panel.")](#)Explore mode in the Studio IDE, showing a chart and Chart/Table/SQL toggles in the dbt Wizard panel.

## Choose a model

With dbt managed inference, you can switch between the supported managed models at any using the model picker dropdown next to the **Agent mode** control (where you choose **Ask for approval** or **Edit files automatically**).

* In [Studio IDE](./wizard-ide.md) and the [dbt Wizard home tab](../platform/wizard-home.md), open the model picker dropdown next to the **Agent mode** control in the dbt Wizard panel, then select a model.
* The picker lists the managed models available to you. Refer to the [Model Provider Rate table](https://www.getdbt.com/legal/dbt-wizard-token-costs-by-model) for the available models and their token rates.
* If you [bring your own key (BYOK)](./wizard-byok.md), dbt Wizard uses the provider and model you configured with your key rather than the managed model picker.
