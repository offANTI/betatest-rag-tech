# dbt Wizard config reference [Beta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")

Local development

dbt Wizard stores configuration in two TOML files under `~/.dbt/wizard/`, each controlling a different part of the product.

## The two config files

We'd love to hear how dbt Wizard is working for you. Share your feedback by either running the `/feedback` slash command in your interactive terminal session or by going to the [#dbt-wizard](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C0B6KLW6T26) channel in the [dbt Community Slack](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/join?version=2.0).

Thanks so much for your help in improving dbt Wizard and dbt data development!

TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) is a config file format. If you've written YAML or JSON before, it'll feel familiar — keys and values are separated by `=` (with spaces before and after the equals sign), and nested sections use `[section.name]` headers instead of indentation or curly braces. For example:

\~/.dbt/wizard/config.toml

```toml
model = "gpt-4o"

[projects."/Users/you/jaffle-shop"]
trust_level = "trusted"
```

This config sets the default AI model for all new sessions and applies to all future invocations across all projects. You can override the default AI model for a specific project by setting the `model` key in the `wizard_config.toml` file for that project or using the `/model` picker in the text-based user interface (TUI).

| File                               | Controls                                                                     | When to use                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.dbt/wizard/config.toml`        | Agent runtime — AI model, MCP servers, approval rules, trusted projects      | Change agent-level behavior across all sessions         |
| `~/.dbt/wizard/wizard_config.toml` | Per-project settings — dbt executable path, deferral, saved model preference | Change how dbt Wizard works with a specific dbt project |

Note that `dbt_project.yml` is separate from both and controls how dbt builds your project.

## Common tasks

| Goal                                      | Edit                                                               | Restart needed? |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Change the default AI model               | `config.toml` → `model = "gpt-4o"`                                 | Yes             |
| Point dbt Wizard at a specific dbt binary | `wizard_config.toml` → `path`                                      | Yes             |
| Add the dbt MCP server                    | `config.toml` → `[mcp_servers.dbt]`                                | Yes             |
| Mark a repo as trusted                    | `config.toml` → `trust_level = "trusted"` under `[projects."..."]` | Yes             |
| Change approval or sandbox defaults       | `config.toml`                                                      | Yes             |

## Config precedence

Settings resolve in this order (highest to lowest):

1. CLI flags (`-m`, `-c`) at invocation
2. In-session model picker (`/model`)
3. `~/.dbt/wizard/config.toml`
4. `~/.dbt/wizard/wizard_config.toml`
5. Built-in defaults

## config.toml

Global agent settings for models, approvals, sandboxing, web search, and MCP servers.

`~/.dbt/wizard/config.toml` controls how the agent session behaves. It's created automatically when dbt Wizard is installed.

### Configuration keys

This is the list of configuration keys that can be set in `config.toml`.

* `model`
* `approval_policy`
* `sandbox_mode`
* `web_search`

You can view more by running `wizard config --help`.

#### AI model and API

New dbt Wizard CLI installs use dbt Labs-managed models out of the box. Refer to [Configure BYOK](./wizard-byok.md) to use a different provider.

| Key     | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model` | string | —       | Default AI model for new sessions. Refer to [AI model ID format](#ai-model-id-format) below. Change interactively with `/model` in the TUI. |

#### Behavior

| Key               | Type   | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `approval_policy` | string | `on-request` | When Wizard asks before executing commands. Options: `untrusted` (ask for non-trusted commands), `on-request` (dbt Wizard decides), `never` (run without asking). |
| `sandbox_mode`    | string | `read-only`  | Shell sandbox policy. Options: `read-only` (default), `workspace-write` (allow writes inside project dir), `danger-full-access` (no restrictions).                |
| `web_search`      | string | `cached`     | Web search mode. Options: `disabled`, `cached`, or `live`.                                                                                                        |

#### Project trust

Set `trust_level` per-project to allow dbt Wizard to use project-local config:

```toml
[projects."/absolute/path/to/your-repo"]
trust_level = "trusted"
```

#### MCP servers

```toml
[mcp_servers.dbt]
command = "DBT_MCP_ENDPOINT"
```

### AI model ID format

AI model IDs in `config.toml` use the public model ID, such as `gpt-4o`.

To list all available AI model IDs:

```bash
wizard debug models
```

### Environment variables

Any key can be set as an environment variable using the `DBT_WIZARD_` prefix in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`:

```bash
export DBT_WIZARD_MODEL=gpt-4o
export DBT_WIZARD_APPROVAL_POLICY=never
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # OpenAI (no prefix needed)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... # Anthropic (no prefix needed)
```

`OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are read directly without the `DBT_WIZARD_` prefix, following each provider's convention.

### When it's read

`config.toml` is read at session start when you run `wizard`. Changes take effect only after you exit and restart the CLI. Per-invocation `-c` flags and the in-session `/model` picker override this file for that session only.

### Example

```toml
model = "gpt-4o"

[projects."/Users/you/jaffle-shop"]
trust_level = "trusted"

[mcp_servers.dbt]
command = "DBT_MCP_ENDPOINT"
```

## wizard\_config.toml

Per-project settings Wizard writes during onboarding, including dbt path and deferral settings.

`~/.dbt/wizard/wizard_config.toml` stores what dbt Wizard knows about each of your dbt projects. dbt Wizard writes to this file automatically during onboarding and when you change project settings. You can also edit it manually.

### Configuration keys

```

#### Deferral

[Deferral](../../reference/node-selection/defer.md) lets dbt Wizard reuse models that are already built elsewhere (for example, in production) instead of rebuilding everything when you're only working on part of a project, saving you time and warehouse cost.

The `deferral.mode` setting in `wizard_config.toml` controls who handles deferral. It accepts six values, and dbt Wizard usually sets it for you during onboarding:

| `deferral.mode` value | What it means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"wizard"`            | dbt Wizard handles deferral for you. You tell dbt Wizard which [target](../local/profiles.yml.md) from your `profiles.yml` to defer to (it tries to detect one automatically when you first set up the project). dbt Wizard then compiles that target and reuses its models for any upstream models you haven't built yourself. |
| `"fusion_cloud"`      | The dbt platform handles deferral against your connected environment, so dbt Wizard doesn't manage any local state. Set automatically when you're connected to the platform.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `"cloud_cli"`         | The dbt platform CLI manages credentials and deferral through the dbt platform, so dbt Wizard skips its production compile and deferral flag injection.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `"dbt_state"`         | dbt State or run cache handles deferral, so dbt Wizard skips its own production compile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `"manual"`            | You provide the deferral manifest directory with `state`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `"disabled"`          | Deferral is disabled for the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

For more about dbt State, refer to [About dbt State](../deploy/dbt-state-about.md).

Set `state` to a directory containing a compatible `manifest.json` when `mode = "manual"`:

```toml

**About [favor-state](../../reference/node-selection/defer.md?version=2.0#favor-state):** `favor_state` is configurable and defaults to `true`. When it is `true`, dbt Wizard passes `--favor-state` so deferred relations take precedence. Set it to `false` to use a relation that already exists in development and fall back to deferred state when it doesn't.

You can also configure production snapshot and compile behavior with global `prod_parse_on_startup`, `prod_parse_args`, `prod_state_ttl_hours`, `prod_state_dir`, and `compile_extra_args` settings. Per-project `compile_extra_args` and `prod_parse_args` values let you override the global behavior for one project. Use a `profile_override` block to select a different profiles file, profile, or target for compilation.

For configuration examples and a verification workflow, refer to [Developing with production deferral](../../best-practices/how-to-use-wizard/wizard-6-production-deferral.md).

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common config mistakes and how to fix them:

| Symptom                                                  | Likely cause                                 | Fix                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Still on old AI model after editing `wizard_config.toml` | `wizard_config.toml` doesn't store the model | Set `model` in `config.toml` and restart `wizard`   |
| AI model unchanged after editing `config.toml`           | Old session still running                    | Press Ctrl+C, then run `wizard` again               |
| "Invalid model" error                                    | Wrong AI model ID                            | Run `wizard debug models` to see valid AI model IDs |

### Re-trigger onboarding flows

If you need to re-run part of the setup — for example, after deleting config entries by mistake or switching to a new project — you can reset individual flows by deleting the relevant file. dbt Wizard will re-prompt you the next time it runs.

To delete a file, run the command in your terminal (macOS/Linux). For example:

```bash
rm ~/.dbt/wizard/auth.json
```

If you get a `No such file or directory` error, the file doesn't exist — which means that part of the setup hasn't run yet, or has already been reset. You can ignore the error.

| What you want to redo             | File to delete                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Re-run the trusted folder prompt  | Remove your project's entry from `~/.dbt/wizard/config.toml` under `[projects."..."]`                                                           |
| Re-authenticate with dbt platform | `~/.dbt/wizard/auth.json`                                                                                                                       |
| Re-run dbt project setup          | Remove your project's entry from `~/.dbt/wizard/wizard_config.toml` under `[projects."..."]`, or delete the file entirely to reset all projects |
| Re-trigger BYOK key configuration | `~/.dbt/wizard/provider*` (this matches all provider files)                                                                                     |

caution

`config.toml` and `wizard_config.toml` are separate files that control different things. If you want to re-run project setup, edit `wizard_config.toml` — not `config.toml`. Editing the wrong file won't re-run the onboarding flow you expect. Refer to [The two config files](#the-two-config-files) at the top of this page for the difference.
