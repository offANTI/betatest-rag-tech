# Continuous integration in dbt

dbt platform

To implement a continuous integration (CI) workflow in dbt, you can set up automation that tests code changes by running [CI jobs](./ci-jobs.md) before merging to production. dbt tracks the state of what’s running in your production environment. When you run a CI job, only the modified data assets in your pull request (PR) and their downstream dependencies are built and tested in a staging schema.

You can also view the status of the CI checks (tests) directly from within the PR; this information is posted to your Git provider as soon as a CI job completes. Additionally, you can enable settings in your Git provider that allow PRs only with successful CI checks to be approved for merging.

For workflows that promote changes after a PR merges (merge jobs or other deployment triggers, including triggering jobs manually or through APIs), refer to [Continuous deployment in dbt](./continuous-deployment.md), including [merge jobs](./merge-jobs.md).

Using CI helps:

* Provide increased confidence and assurances that project changes will work as expected in production.
* Reduce the time it takes to push code changes to production, through build and test automation, leading to better business outcomes.
* Allow organizations to make code changes in a standardized and governed way that ensures code quality without sacrificing speed.

## How CI works

When you [set up CI jobs](./ci-jobs.md#set-up-ci-jobs), dbt listens for a notification from your Git provider indicating that a new PR has been opened or updated with new commits. When dbt receives one of these notifications, it enqueues a new run of the CI job.

dbt builds and tests models, semantic models, metrics, and saved queries affected by the code change in a temporary schema, unique to the PR. This process ensures that the code builds without error and that it matches the expectations as defined by the project's dbt tests. The unique schema name follows the naming convention `dbt_cloud_pr_<job_id>_<pr_id>` (for example, `dbt_cloud_pr_1862_1704`) and can be found in the run details for the given run, as shown in the following image:

When the CI run completes, you can view the run status directly from within the pull request. dbt updates the pull request in GitHub, GitLab, or Azure DevOps with a status message indicating the results of the run. The status message states whether the models and tests ran successfully or not.

dbt deletes the temporary schema from your data warehouse when you close or merge the pull request. If your project has schema customization using the [generate\_schema\_name](../build/custom-schemas.md#how-does-dbt-generate-a-models-schema-name) macro, dbt might not drop the temporary schema from your data warehouse. For more information, refer to [Troubleshooting](./ci-jobs.md#troubleshooting).

## Availability of features by Git provider

* If your git provider has a [native dbt integration](../platform/git/configure-git.md), you can seamlessly set up [continuous integration (CI)](./ci-jobs.md) jobs directly within dbt.

* For providers without native integration, you can still use the [Git clone method](../platform/git/import-a-project-by-git-url.md) to import your git URL and leverage the [dbt Administrative API](../dbt-apis/admin-api.md) to trigger a CI job to run.

The following table outlines the available integration options and their corresponding capabilities.

## Differences between CI jobs and other deployment jobs

The [dbt scheduler](./job-scheduler.md) executes CI jobs differently from other deployment jobs in these important ways:

* [**Concurrent CI checks**](#concurrent-ci-checks) — The scheduler can execute multiple CI runs from the same dbt CI job concurrently (in parallel) when appropriate.
* [**Smart cancellation of stale builds**](#smart-cancellation-of-stale-builds) — The scheduler cancels stale in-flight CI runs when you push new commits to the PR.
* [**Run slot treatment**](#run-slot-treatment) — CI runs don't consume a run slot.
* [**SQL linting**](#sql-linting) — When enabled, linting runs on all SQL files in your project as a step before your CI job builds.

### Concurrent CI checks [Starter](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")

When you collaborate on a dbt project with your team and open pull requests in the same dbt repository, the same CI job can run for each qualifying event.

Each CI run writes to a dedicated, temporary schema that is tied to its pull request. That isolation lets dbt execute CI runs *concurrently* instead of *sequentially*. This differs from deployment dbt jobs.

You don't have to wait for someone else’s CI run to finish before your own check can start. Concurrent CI checks help your whole team test and integrate dbt code faster.

The following describes the conditions when CI checks are run concurrently and when they’re not:

* CI runs with different PR numbers execute concurrently.
* CI runs with the *same* PR number and *different* commit SHAs execute serially because they’re building into the same schema. dbt will run the latest commit and cancel any older, stale commits. For details, refer to [Smart cancellation of stale builds](#smart-cancellation).
* CI runs with the same PR number and same commit SHA can still execute concurrently when they come from different dbt projects. This can happen when two CI jobs are set up in different dbt projects that share the same dbt repository.

### Smart cancellation of stale builds [Starter](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")

When you push a new commit to a PR, dbt enqueues a new CI run for the latest commit and cancels any CI run that is (now) stale and still in flight. This can happen when you’re pushing new commits while a CI build is still in process and not yet done. By canceling runs in a safe and deliberate way, dbt helps improve productivity and reduce data platform spend on wasteful CI runs.

### Run slot treatment [Starter](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")

CI runs don't consume run slots. This guarantees a CI check will never block a production run.

### SQL linting [Starter](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")

Available on [dbt release tracks](../dbt-versions/dbt-release-tracks.md) and dbt Starter or Enterprise-tier accounts.

When [enabled for your CI job](./ci-jobs.md#set-up-ci-jobs), dbt lints the changed SQL files in your project. On v1 runs, dbt invokes [SQLFluff](https://sqlfluff.com/), a modular, configurable SQL linter. On v2 runs, dbt uses the built-in `dbt lint` command instead (see below). Linting warns you about complex functions, syntax, formatting, and compilation errors.

Linting on dbt v2

CI jobs that run on v2 automatically use the built-in [`dbt lint`](../../reference/commands/lint.md?version=2.0) command instead of SQLFluff. `dbt lint` is SQLFluff-compatible and it reads your existing `.sqlfluff` config, uses the same rule codes, and respects `-- noqa` suppression comments.

For parity expectations between `dbt lint` and SQLFluff, refer to [Rule parity with SQLFluff](../../reference/commands/lint.md?version=2.0#rule-parity-with-sqlfluff).

By default, SQL linting lints all the changed SQL files in your project, compared to the last deferred production state.

Note that [snapshots](../build/snapshots.md) can be defined in YAML *and* `.sql` files. Their SQL isn't lintable and can cause errors during linting.

To prevent SQLFluff from linting snapshot files, add the snapshots directory to your `.sqlfluffignore` file (for example `snapshots/`). Refer to [snapshot linting](../platform/studio-ide/lint-format.md#snapshot-linting) for more information.

If the linter runs into errors, you can specify whether dbt should stop running the job on error or continue running it on error. When failing jobs, it helps reduce compute costs by avoiding builds for pull requests that don't meet your SQL code quality CI check.

#### To configure SQLFluff linting

You can optionally configure SQLFluff linting rules to override default linting behavior.

* Use [SQLFluff Configuration Files](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/configuration/setting_configuration.html#configuration-files) to override the default linting behavior in dbt.

* Create a `.sqlfluff` configuration file in your project, add your linting rules to it, and dbt will use them when linting.

  * When configuring, you can use `dbt` as the templater (for example, `templater = dbt`)
  * If you’re using the Studio IDE, dbt CLI, or any other editor, refer to [Customize linting](../platform/studio-ide/lint-format.md#customize-linting) for guidance on how to add the dbt-specific (or dbtonic) linting rules we use for our own project.

* For complete details, refer to [Custom Usage](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/gettingstarted.html#custom-usage) in the SQLFluff documentation.
