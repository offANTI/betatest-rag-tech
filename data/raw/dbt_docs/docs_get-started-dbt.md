# dbt Quickstarts

Begin your dbt journey by choosing how you want to develop:

* [**dbt platform** ](#the-dbt-platform)— Develop in your browser (Studio IDE or Canvas) or use local tools (VS Code extension, dbt platform CLI) that connect to your platform account. The platform provides hosted CI/CD, documentation, and more. Supports both the [dbt Fusion engine](./introduction.md) and [dbt Core](./local/install-dbt.md) engines.
* [**Self-hosted only**](#self-hosted-dbt-installations) — Use local tools like the [dbt VS Code extension](./about-dbt-extension.md) or [install dbt](./local/install-dbt.md) locally, to develop and run dbt on your own infrastructure. You can use local tools with or without a dbt platform account.
* **Local + dbt platform** — Use the VS Code extension or dbt platform CLI with a dbt platform account to develop locally while leveraging platform features like CI/CD, documentation hosting, Insights, Canvas, and more.
* [**dbt Wizard**](#dbt-wizard) — The AI agent for analytics engineering, available in the dbt platform and from your terminal. Grounded in your project's lineage, model health, and semantic definitions.

## The dbt platform

dbt provides a fully managed environment to develop, run, and deploy dbt projects—with CI/CD, documentation hosting, and more. Learn more about [dbt features](./platform/about-platform/dbt-platform-features.md) and [start your free trial](https://www.getdbt.com/signup/) today.

The dbt Fusion engine adds managed execution and a unified development experience so you can focus on building rather than infrastructure.

## Self-hosted dbt installations

When you install dbt into your Windows, macOS, or Linux environment, you get command-line tools and the VS Code extension that enable you to transform data using analytics engineering best practices.

You can use self-hosted tools with or without a dbt platform account. With an account, the VS Code extension and dbt platform CLI sync with your platform project for CI/CD, documentation, and more. Without an account, you run dbt entirely on your own infrastructure.

Develop with a self-hosted installation using the dbt Fusion engine or dbt Core engine.

## dbt Wizard

[dbt Wizard](./platform/wizard-overview.md) is an AI agent purpose-built for analytics engineering. It uses dbt's [native metadata engine](./dbt-ai/about-dbt-ai.md) — a structured index of your project's lineage, model health, tests, and semantic definitions — to build, refactor, validate, and document your project grounded in full project context.

#### [dbt Wizard from your terminal](./dbt-ai/wizard-quickstart.md)

[Install the dbt Wizard CLI to run the agent locally against any dbt project — with or without a dbt platform plan. Start with a free trial using dbt managed AI, or bring your own provider key.](./dbt-ai/wizard-quickstart.md)
