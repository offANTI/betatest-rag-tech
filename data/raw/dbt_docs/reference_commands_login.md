# About dbt login

Available in v2

Use dbt login to authenticate once and unlock advanced features across dbt tools.

info

Available in dbt v2.0 and later.

Run `dbt login` from the command line to unlock advanced dbt features. It'll open browser-based authentication where you can sign in to your existing dbt platform account or create a free one — no credit card required!

Run [`dbt login status`](#dbt-login-status) to view your current authentication status.

## When to use dbt login

`dbt login` is an interactive, browser-based sign-in flow for development on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Use `dbt login` to unlock advanced features including:

* advanced features in the [dbt VS Code extension](../../docs/about-dbt-extension.md)
* [dbt State](../../docs/deploy/dbt-state-setup.md#setting-up-dbt-state) in supported versions
* advanced features in v2.0 CLI

Refer to [VS Code extension features](../../docs/dbt-extension-features.md#feature-availability) for the full list of features and their availability.

`dbt login` doesn't support non-interactive authentication. For [non-interactive](#non-interactive-environments) environments, such as CI/CD jobs, scheduled jobs, or external orchestrators, use a service token instead.

## Before you log in

Downloading the dbt VS Code extension gives you 14 days to try [advanced features](../../docs/dbt-extension-features.md#feature-availability) — no account needed. After the trial ends, sign in to or create a free dbt platform account to keep using them. The vast majority of features keep working either way.

This 14-day trial applies to the dbt VS Code extension only. It's separate from the [dbt platform trial](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing) and doesn't require a credit card or a paid plan.

A free dbt platform account keeps advanced features working after your trial ends and carries your access across all your dbt tools — the CLI, the VS Code extension, and dbt State — so you only log in once. No credit card required.

Run `dbt login` to create a free account, or log in to an existing one. Logging in is simply how dbt confirms your access to advanced features in your local development environment.

Note that this is separate from [dbt platform user license types](../../docs/platform/manage-access/seats-and-users.md?version=2.0) (such as Developer or Analyst), which controls what you can do *inside* dbt platform.

Refer to [VS Code extension features](../../docs/dbt-extension-features.md#feature-availability) for the full list of features and their availability.

(Applies to dbt v1.13 and later)

## `dbt login` with dbt State

[`dbt login`](./login.md?version=2.0#dbt-login---help) is also used for dbt State authentication. Running this command opens a browser window where you can:

* Log in with your dbt platform account.

* Create a dbt platform account:

  1. Enter your email address and click **Continue**.
  2. Enter you name, password, and agree to the Terms of Service.
  3. Click **Continue**.
  4. Verify your e-mail address.

In the dbt Fusion engine, after platform authentication, the CLI checks your configuration and responds accordingly:

| dbt State enabled in dbt platform? | dbt State enabled locally? | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅                                 | ✅                         | dbt State is ready to use.                                                                                                                                                      |
| ✅                                 | ❌                         | CLI prompts you to enable dbt State locally. If you confirm, [`user_settings.yml`](../global-configs/user-settings.md) is updated automatically. |
| ❌                                 | ✅                         | CLI prompts you to enable dbt State in your platform account.                                                                                                                   |

## Authentication methods

`dbt login` is interactive only. It opens a browser-based sign-in flow and stores your session locally.

You can log into dbt either using [interactive](#interactive-authentication) or [non-interactive](#non-interactive-environments) methods.

### Interactive authentication

Use `dbt login` when you're developing locally in a terminal or IDE and can complete sign-in in a browser.

* When you run `dbt login`, dbt opens a browser-based authentication flow. After you complete authentication, dbt stores your login state locally and confirms that you're signed in.
* After you sign in, dbt can use your login state to unlock advanced features across the dbt CLI, VS Code extension, and dbt State.
* Your session stays active across terminal sessions, and dbt refreshes it automatically while you're active. As long as you use dbt at least once every 7 days, you stay signed in. If you're inactive for longer, dbt prompts you to run `dbt login` again. Refer to [Staying signed in](#staying-signed-in) for details.

Run `dbt login` from your **local terminal** (not in the dbt platform UI).

**Example (interactive):**

```shell
dbt login
dbt login status
```

Complete the browser prompts to sign in or register for a dbt platform account.

### Non-interactive environments

Non-interactive means dbt runs without a person at a keyboard to open a browser — for example, a GitHub Actions workflow, a cron job, or a scheduled dbt platform job. There is no separate "non-interactive login" command. You do not run `dbt login` in these environments.

If you are new to dbt, start with [interactive authentication](#interactive-authentication). You only need the guidance in this section when you automate dbt runs.

#### Authenticate with a service token

In non-interactive environments (such as CI/CD jobs, scheduled jobs, or external orchestrators like Airflow), use a [service token](../../docs/dbt-apis/service-tokens.md) instead of `dbt login`. The service token does two jobs:

* authenticates the run
* unlocks access to advanced features, so they work in your pipeline the same way they do locally.

Unlike interactive `dbt login`, service tokens don't expire, so there's nothing to refresh. Rotate them yourself in dbt platform when you need to.

Set the following [environment variables](../../docs/build/environment-variables.md#special-environment-variables) so dbt can authenticate and unlock that access:

| Environment variable     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DBT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_HOST` | Your dbt platform [access URL](../../docs/platform/about-platform/access-regions-ip-addresses.md) (for example, `abc123.us1.dbt.com`).                                         |
| `DBT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID`   | Your dbt platform account ID.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `DBT_CLOUD_TOKEN`        | The service token value. Create a service token with a permission set that includes feature licensing access, such as `Job Runner`, `Job Creator`, `Job Admin`, `Developer`, or `Account Admin`. |
| `DBT_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`   | Your dbt platform project ID.                                                                                                                                                                    |

```shell
export DBT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_HOST=abc123.us1.dbt.com
export DBT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID=12345
export DBT_CLOUD_TOKEN=dbtc_xxxxxxxx
export DBT_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=67890
```

## How shared login works across dbt tools

* Use `dbt login` to authenticate with [dbt State](../../docs/deploy/dbt-state-about.md). You can start the sign-in flow from the [dbt VS Code extension](../../docs/about-dbt-extension.md):
* If you run `dbt login` from the CLI, the dbt VS Code extension uses that login in your next extension session.
* If you sign in from the dbt VS Code extension, you can use that login the next time you run a command that requires authentication.

When you run a command or use a feature that requires authentication, dbt checks your current login state. If you're signed in, the feature runs. If you're not signed in, dbt tells you which feature requires authentication and prompts you to run `dbt login`.

For the VS Code extension registration flow, refer to [Sign in or register](../../docs/sign-in-dbt-extension.md).

## Staying signed in

Once you log in, dbt keeps you signed in automatically — you usually won't notice it at all.

You stay signed in as long as you use dbt at least once every 7 days. If you're inactive for longer than that, dbt might ask you to log in again in your next session to ensure security.

If your access expires, run `dbt login` to sign back in.

* On the 14-day trial without a dbt account? Create a free account with `dbt login` — it's the best way to use the [full set of features](../../docs/dbt-extension-features.md#feature-availability) and get the most out of the extension.
* Not ready to run `dbt login`? No worries — continue using the vast majority of features after the trial ends.

If you're not sure where you stand, run [`dbt license info`](#troubleshooting) to check your status.

## Usage

This page lists the commands and output you can use with `dbt login`:

* [`dbt login`](#dbt-login)
* [`dbt login --help`](#dbt-login---help)
* [`dbt login status`](#dbt-login-status)
* [`dbt license info`](#dbt-license-info)

### dbt login

Run `dbt login` from your terminal to open browser-based authentication:

```shell
dbt login
```

The CLI opens your default browser and shows the authentication URL:

```text
Opening your browser to complete login...
→ https://us1.dbt.com/register

If you need to reset your password, complete the reset, then re-run dbt login to finish authenticating.
Waiting for authentication…
```

After you sign in or register, dbt saves your credentials to your local dbt configuration directory:

* macOS and Linux: `~/.dbt/`
* Windows: `C:\Users\[username]\.dbt\`

Refer to [Staying signed in](#staying-signed-in) for details on how long you stay signed in.

When authentication completes successfully, the CLI shows:

```text
Congratulations! You are now signed in.
```

When authentication fails, the CLI shows:

```text
Authentication failed. Re-run dbt login to try again.

[Placeholder for user-facing error message on failure reason]
```

dbt State and dbt login

If you have a dbt platform account, you can use the same account to authenticate with dbt State — no separate sign-in required. For full dbt State setup, refer to [Setting up dbt State](../../docs/deploy/dbt-state-setup.md).

### dbt login --help

```text
Usage: dbt login [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  status          Show dbt authentication status
```

### dbt login status

Run `dbt login status` to show whether dbt is authenticated:

```shell
dbt login status
```

If dbt is authenticated, the CLI shows the authentication method:

```text
Status: authenticated (via METHOD)
```

If dbt is not authenticated, the CLI shows:

```text
Status: unauthenticated
```

### dbt license info

dbt uses local licenses to cache your logged-in state and give you access to advanced features. Run `dbt license info` as an additional check to verify the status of the license used by Fusion. This is useful when an advanced feature isn't working and `dbt login status` tells you you're authenticated:

```shell
dbt license info
```

The output should look like this:

```shell
dbtf license info
...
status: valid
licensing_enabled: true
license_type: developer
features: compare, state-aware-orchestration, strict-static-analysis
issued_at: June 17, 2026 10:55 UTC
expires_at: June 18, 2026 10:55 UTC
```

Add `--json` for machine-readable output:

```shell
dbt license info --json
```

For how to interpret each status, refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Troubleshooting

If an advanced feature isn't working, or you're not sure whether you're still signed in, run `dbt license info` to check your access:

```shell
dbt license info
```

Add `--json` for machine-readable output:

```shell
dbt license info --json
```

The output shows your current status. Use the following table to interpret it:

| Status            | What it means                                      | What to do                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `valid`           | You're signed in and your features are available.  | Nothing — you're all set.                                                                                     |
| `trial_expired`   | Your 14-day dbt VS Code extension trial has ended. | [Sign in or register](../../docs/sign-in-dbt-extension.md) for a free dbt platform account. |
| `expired`         | Your access has expired.                           | Run `dbt login` to sign in again.                                                                             |
| `not_found`       | dbt couldn't find any sign-in for you.             | Run `dbt login`, or set a [service token](#authenticate-with-a-service-token) for orchestrated runs.          |
| `invalid`         | Your access failed validation.                     | Run `dbt login` to refresh it.                                                                                |
| `transient_error` | A temporary network or server issue.               | Retry — your cached access stays active in the meantime.                                                      |

If you just registered a new account

If you created a new dbt platform account but haven't verified your email yet, dbt warns you on each run during a short grace period.

After the grace period ends, advanced features stop working until you verify. You can still use the vast majority of features like code error diagnostics and Jinja LSP go-to ref definition, [and more](../../docs/dbt-extension-features.md#feature-availability).

Check your inbox for the verification email, or [contact dbt Support](../../docs/dbt-support.md) if you need it resent.
