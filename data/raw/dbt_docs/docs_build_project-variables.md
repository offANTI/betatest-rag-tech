# Project variables

dbt provides a mechanism called [variables](../../reference/dbt-jinja-functions/var.md) to provide data to models for compilation. Variables allow you to define configurable values for your project instead of hardcoding them in SQL.

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

You can define variables in three ways:

* In the `vars.yml` file (recommended for projects with several variables, or when you need to reference variables from within [`dbt_project.yml`](../../reference/dbt_project.yml.md))
* In the `dbt_project.yml` file
* On the command line

Variables defined in the `vars.yml` or `dbt_project.yml` act as project-wide defaults. These defaults apply anywhere the variable is referenced. You can override them at runtime using the `--vars` command-line argument, which is useful when you want to change a value for a specific run. For example, when testing with a different date range or running models with environment-specific settings.

You might use variables to [configure timezones](https://github.com/dbt-labs/snowplow/blob/0.3.9/dbt_project.yml#L22), set reporting date ranges, [avoid hardcoding table names](https://github.com/dbt-labs/quickbooks/blob/v0.1.0/dbt_project.yml#L23), or otherwise control how models are compiled.

To use a variable in a model, hook, or macro, use the `{{ var('...') }}` function. The `var()` function retrieves the value defined in your project or passed using `--vars`. For more information, see [About var function](../../reference/dbt-jinja-functions/var.md).

Note, refer to [YAML tips](./dbt-tips.md#yaml-tips) for more YAML information.

### Defining variables in `vars.yml`

`vars.yml` is a dedicated file for project variables located at the project root. Because dbt parses it *before* `dbt_project.yml`, variables from `vars.yml` are available when `dbt_project.yml` is evaluated, so you can reference them in `dbt_project.yml` using `{{ var('...') }}`. For more information, refer to [Using vars.yml variables in dbt\_project.yml](#using-varsyml-variables-in-dbt_projectyml).

To define variables in a `vars.yml` file, add a `vars` config. You can scope these variables globally, or to a specific package imported in your project. The following example shows variables in a `vars.yml` file:

vars.yml

```yaml
vars:
  # The `start_date` variable is accessible to all resources
  start_date: '2016-06-01'
  
  # The `platforms` variable is only accessible to resources in the my_dbt_project project
  my_dbt_project:
    platforms: ['web', 'mobile']
  
  # The `app_ids` variable is only accessible to resources in the snowplow package
  snowplow:
    app_ids: ['marketing', 'app', 'landing-page']
```

You cannot define variables in both `vars.yml` and `dbt_project.yml`. If both files contain a `vars` block with definitions, dbt raises an error.

If `vars.yml` is empty or doesn't exist, variables defined in `dbt_project.yml` are used instead.

#### Using `vars.yml` variables in `dbt_project.yml`

Because `vars.yml` is parsed before `dbt_project.yml`, you can reference variables from `vars.yml` within `dbt_project.yml` using `{{ var('...') }}`. Variables referenced in `dbt_project.yml` are resolved only from `vars.yml` or the `--vars` command-line argument, not from the `vars` block in `dbt_project.yml` itself. If `dbt_project.yml` references a variable that is defined only in its own `vars` block, dbt raises an error.

For example, you have the following variables defined in `vars.yml`:

vars.yml

```yaml
vars:
  schema_name: analytics
  materialization: table
```

You can reference them in `dbt_project.yml`:

dbt\_project.yml

```yaml
models:
  my_dbt_project:
    +schema: "{{ var('schema_name') }}"
    +materialized: "{{ var('materialization') }}"
```

### Defining variables in `dbt_project.yml`

info

Jinja is not supported within the `vars` config, and all values will be interpreted literally.

To define variables in a dbt project, add a `vars` config to your `dbt_project.yml` file. These `vars` can be scoped globally, or to a specific package imported in your project.

dbt\_project.yml

```yaml
name: my_dbt_project
version: 1.0.0

config-version: 2

vars:
  # The `start_date` variable will be accessible in all resources
  start_date: '2016-06-01'

  # The `platforms` variable is only accessible to resources in the my_dbt_project project
  my_dbt_project:
    platforms: ['web', 'mobile']

  # The `app_ids` variable is only accessible to resources in the snowplow package
  snowplow:
    app_ids: ['marketing', 'app', 'landing-page']

models:
    ...
```

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

You cannot define variables in both `vars.yml` and `dbt_project.yml`. If both files contain a `vars` block with definitions, dbt raises an error.

### Defining variables on the command line

The `dbt_project.yml` file is a great place to define variables that rarely change.

When you need to override a variable for a specific run, use the `--vars` command line option. For example, when you want to test with a different date range, run models with environment-specific settings, or adjust behavior dynamically.

Use `--vars` to pass one or more variables to a dbt command. Provide the argument as a YAML dictionary string.

For example:

```shell
$ dbt run --vars '{"event_type": "signup"}'
```

You can use the same `--vars` syntax with other dbt commands, such as `dbt snapshot`:

```shell
$ dbt snapshot --select my_snapshot --vars '{"cutoff_date": "2026-01-01"}'
```

Inside a model, snapshot, or macro, access the value using the `var()` function:

```shell
select '{{ var("event_type") }}' as event_type
```

When you pass variables using `--vars`, you can access them anywhere you use the `var()` function in your project.

You can pass multiple variables at once:

```shell
$ dbt run --vars '{event_type: signup, region: us}'
```

If only one variable is being set, the brackets are optional:

```shell
$ dbt run --vars 'event_type: signup'
```

The `--vars` argument accepts a YAML dictionary as a string on the command line. YAML is convenient because it does not require strict quoting as with JSON.

Both of the following are valid and equivalent:

```shell
$ dbt run --vars '{"key": "value", "date": 20180101}'
$ dbt run --vars '{key: value, date: 20180101}'
```

Variables defined using `--var`, override values defined in `dbt_project.yml`. This makes `--vars` useful for temporarily overriding configuration without changing your committed project files. For the complete order of precedence (including package-scoped variables and default values defined in `var()`), see [Variable precedence](./project-variables.md#variable-precedence).

You can find more information on defining dictionaries with YAML [here](https://github.com/Animosity/CraftIRC/wiki/Complete-idiot%27s-introduction-to-yaml).

### Variable precedence

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

Variables defined with the `--vars` command line argument override variables defined in `vars.yml` or `dbt_project.yml`. They are globally scoped and accessible to the root project and all installed packages.

The order of precedence for variable declaration is as follows (highest priority first):

1. The variables defined on the command line with `--vars`
2. The package-scoped variable declaration in the root `vars.yml` file (if present)
3. The global variable declaration in the root `vars.yml` file (if present)
4. The package-scoped variable declaration in the root `dbt_project.yml` file
5. The global variable declaration in the root `dbt_project.yml` file
6. If this node is defined in a package: variable declarations in that package's `dbt_project.yml` file
7. The variable's default argument (if one is provided)

`vars.yml` is parsed *before* `dbt_project.yml`, so variables defined in `vars.yml` are available when `dbt_project.yml` is parsed. If `vars.yml` is empty or doesn't exist, variables from `dbt_project.yml` are used instead. When any variable (in `vars.yml`, `dbt_project.yml`, or from the command line) changes, partial parsing is disabled for the next run.

If dbt is unable to find a definition for a variable after checking all possible variable declaration places, then a compilation error will be raised.

**Note:** Variable scope is based on the node ultimately using that variable. Imagine the case where a model defined in the root project is calling a macro defined in an installed package. That macro, in turn, uses the value of a variable. The variable will be resolved based on the *root project's* scope, rather than the package's scope.
