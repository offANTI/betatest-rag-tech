The dbt profile for Rockset is very simple and contains the following fields:

profiles.yml

```yaml
rockset:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: rockset
      workspace: [schema]
      api_key: [api_key]
      api_server: [api_server] # (Default is api.rs2.usw2.rockset.com)
```

### Materializations

| Type        | Supported? | Details                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| view        | YES        | Creates a [view](https://rockset.com/docs/views/#gatsby-focus-wrapper).                                                                |
| table       | YES        | Creates a [collection](https://rockset.com/docs/collections/#gatsby-focus-wrapper).                                                    |
| ephemeral   | YES        | Executes queries using CTEs.                                                                                                           |
| incremental | YES        | Creates a [collection](https://rockset.com/docs/collections/#gatsby-focus-wrapper) if it doesn't exist, and then writes results to it. |

## Caveats

1. `unique_key` is not supported with incremental, unless it is set to [\_id](https://rockset.com/docs/special-fields/#the-_id-field), which acts as a natural `unique_key` in Rockset anyway.
2. The `table` materialization is slower in Rockset than most due to Rockset's architecture as a low-latency, real-time database. Creating new collections requires provisioning hot storage to index and serve fresh data, which takes about a minute.
3. Rockset queries have a two-minute timeout. Any model which runs a query that takes longer to execute than two minutes will fail.
