## Installing dbt-athena

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-athena`

## Configuring dbt-athena

For Athena-specific configuration, please refer to [Athena configs.](../../../reference/resource-configs/athena-configs.md)

`dbt-athena` vs `dbt-athena-community`

`dbt-athena-community` was the community-maintained adapter until dbt Labs took over maintenance in late 2024. Both `dbt-athena` and `dbt-athena-community` are maintained by dbt Labs, but `dbt-athena-community` is now simply a wrapper on `dbt-athena`, published for backwards compatibility.

## Connecting to Athena with dbt-athena

This plugin does not accept any credentials directly. Instead, [credentials are determined automatically](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html) based on AWS CLI/boto3 conventions and stored login info. You can configure the AWS profile name to use via `aws_profile_name`. Alternatively, you can set explicit credential keys in the profile: `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, and, for [AWS STS temporary credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html), `aws_session_token` (must match exactly).
