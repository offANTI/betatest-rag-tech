# About the dbt VS Code extension [Preview](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")

Local development

The dbt VS Code extension brings a hyper-fast, intelligent, and cost-efficient dbt development experience to VS Code. This is the only way to enjoy all the power of the dbt Fusion engine while developing with a self-hosted installation.

* *Save time and resources* with near-instant parsing, live error detection, powerful IntelliSense capabilities, and more.
* *Stay in flow* with a seamless, end-to-end dbt development experience designed from scratch for local dbt development.

The dbt VS Code extension is available in the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbtLabsInc.dbt). *Note, this is a public preview release. Behavior may change ahead of the broader generally available (GA) release.*

The dbt VS Code extension works with Fusion, the default free-to-use product you get when you install dbt.

Try out the Fusion quickstart guide

Check out the [Fusion quickstart guide](../guides/dbt.md?step=1) to try the dbt VS Code extension in action.

## Navigating the dbt extension

Once the dbt VS Code extension has been installed, several visual enhancements will be added to your IDE to help you navigate the features and functionality. To read more about the features and functionality, see the [dbt extension features](./dbt-extension-features.md).

Check out the following video to see the features and functionality of the dbt VS Code extension:

[dbt Fusion + VS Code extension walkthrough](https://app.storylane.io/share/a1rkqx0mbd7a)

### Sign in and feature access

After you install the dbt VS Code extension, all [features](./dbt-extension-features.md) are available for 14 days with no registration. After that, most features continue to work without registration. To keep using advanced features, [register](./sign-in-dbt-extension.md) for a free dbt platform account. Previously only registered users had access to the dbt VS Code extension.

Without registration, the vast majority of features continue to work. Only advanced features prompt you to register or sign in to an existing account after the trial period ends.

Strict static analysis requires registration

If your project uses `static_analysis: strict` in `dbt_project.yml` or you pass `--static-analysis strict` at runtime, registration for a dbt platform account is required regardless of the trial status.

Refer to [VS Code extension features](./dbt-extension-features.md#feature-availability) for the full list of features and their availability.

When you register or sign in for advanced features, authentication is handled by [`dbt login`](../reference/commands/login.md?version=2.0). Your login state is shared across the CLI, dbt VS Code extension, and dbt State (if you log in using dbt platform). You can use the [get started wizard](./install-dbt-extension.md#getting-started) or run `dbt login` from your terminal, then restart or reload VS Code. The extension detects your login automatically.

### The dbt extension menu

The dbt logo on the sidebar (or the **dbt Extension** text on the bottom tray) launches the main menu for the extension. This menu contains helpful information and actions you can take:

* **Get started button:** Launches the [Fusion upgrade](./upgrade-to-dbt-extension.md) workflow.
* **Extension info:** Information about the extension, Fusion, and your dbt project. Includes configuration options and actions.
* **Help:** Quick links to support, bug submissions, and documentation.

### Caching

The dbt extension caches important schema information from your data warehouse to improve speed and performance. This will automatically update over time, but if recent changes have been made that aren't reflected in your project, you can manually update the schema information:

1. Click the **dbt logo** on the sidebar to open the menu.
2. Expand the **Extension info** section and location the **Actions** subsection.
3. Click **Clear Cache** to update.

## Using the extension

Your dbt environment must be using the dbt Fusion engine in order to use this extension. See [the Fusion documentation](./introduction.md) for more on eligibility and upgrading.

Once installed, the dbt extension automatically activates when you open any `.sql` or `.yml` file inside of a dbt project directory.

## Configuration

After installation, you may want to configure the extension to better fit your development workflow:

1. Open the VS Code settings by pressing `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+,` (Mac).
2. Search for `dbt`. On this page, you can adjust the extension’s configuration options to fit your needs.

## Known limitations

The following are currently known limitations of the dbt extension:

* **Remote development:** The dbt extension does not yet support remote development sessions over SSH. Support will be added in a future release. For more information on remote development, refer to [Supporting Remote Development and GitHub Codespaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions) and [Visual Studio Code Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server).

* **Working with YAML files:** Today, the dbt extension has the following limitations with operating on YAML files:

  * Go-to-definition is not supported for nodes defined in YAML files (like snapshots).
  * Renaming models and columns will not update references in YAML files.
  * Future releases of the dbt extension will address these limitations.

* **Renaming models:** When you rename a model file, the dbt extension applies edits to update all `ref()` calls that reference the renamed model. Due to limitations of VS Code's Language Server Client, the extension can't auto-save these edited files. As a result, renaming a model file may cause compiler errors in your project. To fix these errors, either manually save each file that the dbt extension edited, or click **File** --> **Save All** to save all edited files.

* **Using Cursor's Agent mode:** When using the dbt extension in Cursor, lineage visualization works best in Editor mode and doesn't render in Agent mode. If you're working in Agent mode and need to view lineage, switch to Editor mode to access the full lineage tab functionality.

### Extension conflicts

The extension may occasionally conflict with other VS Code extensions that provide similar services (such as code validation). You may need to disable these third-party extensions while working with the dbt extension.

**YAML by Red Hat:**

The YAML extension by Red Hat may erroneously flag some keys (such as `static_analysis`) in dbt YAML files as invalid in the IDE.

[![Static analysis erroneously tagged as invalid](/img/docs/extension/false-yaml-error.png?v=2 "Static analysis erroneously tagged as invalid")](#)Static analysis erroneously tagged as invalid

To solve this issue, do one of the following:

* (Recommended) Disable the Red Hat YAML extension while working with the dbt extension.

* Add the following configuration to your VS Code `settings.json` file:

  ```json
  "yaml.schemas": {
      "Core/dbtschema.json": "data/dbt/models/**/schema.yml",
      "": "data/dbt/dbt_project.yml"
  },
  ```

  This could disable *all* use of the schema store, resulting in unintended consequences.

## dbt Wizard

The dbt VS Code extension and [dbt Wizard](./dbt-ai/wizard-quickstart.md) are designed to work together. The extension, powered by the dbt Fusion engine, gives you fast parsing, inline error detection, and IntelliSense. [dbt Wizard](./dbt-ai/wizard-quickstart.md) adds an AI layer on top — one that works with a live understanding of your project through dbt's [native metadata engine](./dbt-ai/about-dbt-ai.md), a structured index of your [lineage](./explore/explore-projects.md), model health, test coverage, and semantic definitions.

* **Build and refactor from natural language**: Describe what you want, review the diff, approve or redirect before anything is saved.
* **Validate changes before they land**: The agent compiles and runs against your warehouse in a tight loop — not just editor linting.
* **Work with your full project map**: Traverse the [DAG](./explore/explore-projects.md), understand downstream impact, and keep tests and YAML in sync as models change.

For data practitioners, combining the extension's Fusion-powered editor experience with dbt Wizard's project-aware agent means less manual YAML, fewer context switches, and faster iteration on complex modeling work. See [dbt Wizard quickstart](./dbt-ai/wizard-quickstart.md) to get started.
