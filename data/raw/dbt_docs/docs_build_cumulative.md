# Cumulative metrics

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

Cumulative metrics aggregate values from other metrics across a defined accumulation period. If you don’t specify a period, the metric accumulates values over the entire available time range.

Use cumulative metrics when you want to calculate rolling or period-to-date values, such as weekly active users or month-to-date revenue.

* You must create a [time spine model](./metricflow-time-spine.md) before you define cumulative metrics so that MetricFlow can join time-based aggregations to the time spine.
* If a cumulative metric depends on metrics or dimensions defined in a different semantic model, set cumulative metrics under the top level `metrics` key.

## Parameters

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Required | Type    |

### Complete specification

The following displays the complete specification for cumulative metrics, along with an example:

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: my_advanced_cumulative_metric # required 
    description: my_description # optional
    label: my_label # optional
    type: cumulative # required --  cumulative | ratio | derived | conversion
    # if cumulative, optionally can supply window or grain_to_date, but not both
    window: 1 week # (interval)
    # grain_to_date: hour # hour | day | week | month | year | ...
    input_metric: # required, must refer to metric name or metric dict
      name: my_metric_name_from_another_semantic_model
      filter: "{{ Dimension('entity__dimension_name') }} > 10"
      alias: my_metric_name_a_week_ago_in_another_semantic_model
```

## Cumulative metrics example

Cumulative metrics measure data over a given window and consider the window infinite when no window parameter is passed, accumulating the data over all time.

The following example shows how to define cumulative metrics in a YAML file:

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

* `cumulative_order_total`: Calculates the cumulative order total over all time. Uses `input_metric` to specify the simple metric `order_total` to be aggregated.

* `cumulative_order_total_l1m`: Calculates the trailing 1-month cumulative order total. Uses `window` parameter to specify a window of 1 month.

* `cumulative_order_total_mtd`: Calculates the month-to-date cumulative order total. Uses `grain_to_date` parameter to specify a grain of `month`.

models/marts/fct\_orders.yml

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: cumulative_order_total
    label: "Cumulative order total (All-Time)"    
    description: "The cumulative value of all orders"
    type: cumulative
    input_metric: order_total
  
  - name: cumulative_order_total_l1m
    label: "Cumulative order total (L1M)"   
    description: "Trailing 1-month cumulative order total"
    type: cumulative
    window: 1 month
    input_metric: order_total
  
  - name: cumulative_order_total_mtd
    label: "Cumulative order total (MTD)"
    description: "The month-to-date value of all orders"
    type: cumulative
    grain_to_date: month
    input_metric: order_total
```

### Granularity options

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

Use the `period_agg` parameter with `first`, `last`, and `average` functions to aggregate cumulative metrics over the requested period. This is because granularity options for cumulative metrics are different than the options for other metric types.

* For other metrics, we use the `date_trunc` function to implement granularity.
* However, cumulative metrics are non-additive (values can't be added up), so we can't use the `date_trunc` function to change their time grain granularity.
* By default, we take the first value of the period. You can change this by specifying a different function using the `period_agg` parameter.

In the following example, we define a cumulative metric, `cumulative_revenue`, that calculates the cumulative revenue for all orders:

models/marts/fct\_orders.yml

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: cumulative_revenue
    description: "The cumulative revenue for all orders."
    label: "Cumulative revenue (all-time)"
    type: cumulative
    input_metric: revenue
    period_agg: first # Optional. Defaults to first. Accepted values: first|last|average
```

In this example, `period_agg` is set to `first`, which chooses the first value for the selected granularity window. To query `cumulative_revenue` by week, use the following query syntax:

* `dbt sl query --metrics cumulative_revenue --group-by metric_time__week`

 Expand toggle to view how the SQL compiles

Note the use of the `window` function to select the `first` value. For `last` and `average`, we would replace the `first_value()` function in the generated SQL with `last_value()` and `average` respectively.

```sql
-- re-aggregate metric via the group by
select
  metric_time__week,
  metric_time__quarter,
  revenue_all_time
from (
  -- window function for metric re-aggregation
  select
    metric_time__week,
    metric_time__quarter,
    first_value(revenue_all_time) over (
      partition by
        metric_time__week,
        metric_time__quarter
      order by metric_time__day
      rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following
    ) as revenue_all_time
  from (
    -- join self over time range
    -- pass only elements: ['txn_revenue', 'metric_time__week', 'metric_time__quarter', 'metric_time__day']
    -- aggregate measures
    -- compute metrics via expressions
    select
      subq_11.metric_time__day as metric_time__day,
      subq_11.metric_time__week as metric_time__week,
      subq_11.metric_time__quarter as metric_time__quarter,
      sum(revenue_src_28000.revenue) as revenue_all_time
    from (
      -- time spine
      select
        ds as metric_time__day,
        date_trunc('week', ds) as metric_time__week,
        date_trunc('quarter', ds) as metric_time__quarter
      from mf_time_spine subq_12
      group by
        ds,
        date_trunc('week', ds),
        date_trunc('quarter', ds)
    ) subq_11
    inner join fct_revenue revenue_src_28000
    on (
      date_trunc('day', revenue_src_28000.created_at) <= subq_11.metric_time__day
    )
    group by
      subq_11.metric_time__day,
      subq_11.metric_time__week,
      subq_11.metric_time__quarter
  ) subq_16
) subq_17
group by
  metric_time__week,
  metric_time__quarter,
  revenue_all_time
```

### Window options

This section details examples of when to specify and not to specify window options.

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

* When a period is specified, MetricFlow applies a sliding window to the underlying simple metric, such as tracking weekly active users with a 7-day window.
* Without specifying a period, cumulative metrics accumulate values over all time, useful for running totals like current revenue and active subscriptions.

 Example of window specified

If a window option is specified, MetricFlow applies a sliding window to the underlying metric.

Suppose the underlying metrics, `customers`, is configured to count the unique customers making orders at the Jaffle shop:

models/marts/customers.yml

```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    semantic_model:
      enabled: true
      ...

    metrics:
      - name: customers
        description: "Unique customers making orders at the Jaffle shop"
        label: "Customers"
        type: simple
        agg: count_distinct
        expr: customer_id
```

We can write a cumulative metric `weekly_customers` as such:

models/marts/customers.yml

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: weekly_customers
    description: "Weekly active customers with a 7-day sliding window"
    label: "Weekly Active Customers"
    type: cumulative
    input_metric: customers
    window: 7 days
    period_agg: first # When using non-default granularity with cumulative metrics, re-aggregation is required. period_agg: first selects the first value in each granularity window during re-aggregation.
```

From the sample YAML example, note the following:

* `type`: Specify cumulative to indicate the type of metric.
* `input_metric`: Specify the metric to be aggregated (in this case, `customers`).
* `window`: Specify the accumulation window (in this case, 7 days).
* `period_agg`: Specify the re-aggregation function (in this case, `first`).
* `grain_to_date`: Specify the grain to date (in this case, `week`).

For example, in the `weekly_customers` cumulative metric, MetricFlow takes a sliding 7-day window of relevant customers and applies a count distinct function.

If you remove `window`, the metric will accumulate over all time.

 Example of window not specified

Suppose you (a subscription-based company for the sake of this example) have an event-based log table with the following columns:

* `date`: a date column
* `user_id`: (integer) an ID specified for each user that is responsible for the event
* `subscription_plan`: (integer) a column that indicates a particular subscription plan associated with the user.
* `subscription_revenue`: (integer) a column that indicates the value associated with the subscription plan.
* `event_type`: (integer) a column that populates with +1 to indicate an added subscription, or -1 to indicate a deleted subscription.
* `revenue`: (integer) a column that multiplies `event_type` and `subscription_revenue` to depict the amount of revenue added or lost for a specific date.

Using cumulative metrics without specifying a window, you can calculate running totals for metrics like the count of active subscriptions and revenue at any point in time. The following YAML file shows creating a cumulative metrics to obtain current revenue and the total number of active subscriptions as a cumulative sum using the `revenue` and `subscription_count` metrics:

models/marts/fct\_orders.yml

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: current_revenue
    description: "Current revenue"
    label: "Current Revenue"
    type: cumulative
    input_metric: revenue
  - name: active_subscriptions
    description: "Count of active subscriptions"
    label: "Active Subscriptions"
    type: cumulative
    input_metric: subscription_count
```

### Grain to date

You can choose to specify a grain to date in your cumulative metric configuration to accumulate a metric from the start of a grain (such as week, month, or year). When using a window, such as a month, MetricFlow will go back one full calendar month. However, grain to date will always start accumulating from the beginning of the grain, regardless of the latest date of data.

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

For example, let's consider an underlying simple metric `order_total` defined within a semantic model:

```yaml
models:
  - name: fct_orders
    semantic_model:
      enabled: true
    
    # Simple metrics defined within semantic model
    metrics:
      - name: order_total
        description: "Sum of order total amounts"
        type: simple
        agg: sum
        expr: order_total
```

We can compare the difference between a 1-month window and a monthly grain to date.

* The cumulative metric in a window approach applies a sliding window of 1 month
* The grain to date by month resets at the beginning of each month.

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

models/marts/fct\_orders.yml

```yaml
# Top-level metrics key for cumulative metrics
metrics:
  - name: cumulative_order_total_mtd
    label: "Cumulative order total (MTD)"
    description: "The month-to-date value of all orders"
    type: cumulative
    grain_to_date: month
    input_metric: order_total
```

Cumulative metric with grain to date:

(Applies to dbt v1.12 and later)

models/marts/fct\_orders.yml

```yaml
# Top-level metrics key for cumulative metrics
metrics:
  - name: orders_last_month_to_date
    label: "Orders month to date"
    description: "Month-to-date count of orders"
    type: cumulative
    grain_to_date: month
    input_metric: order_count
```

## SQL implementation example

To calculate the cumulative value of the metric over a given window we do a time range join to a timespine table using the primary time dimension as the join key. We use the accumulation window in the join to decide whether a record should be included on a particular day. The following SQL code produced from an example cumulative metric is provided for reference:

To implement cumulative metrics, refer to the SQL code example:

```sql
select
  count(distinct distinct_users) as weekly_active_users,
  metric_time
from (
  select
    subq_3.distinct_users as distinct_users,
    subq_3.metric_time as metric_time
  from (
    select
      subq_2.distinct_users as distinct_users,
      subq_1.metric_time as metric_time
    from (
      select
        metric_time
      from transform_prod_schema.mf_time_spine subq_1356
      where (
        metric_time >= cast('2000-01-01' as timestamp)
      ) and (
        metric_time <= cast('2040-12-31' as timestamp)
      )
    ) subq_1
    inner join (
      select
        distinct_users as distinct_users,
        date_trunc('day', ds) as metric_time
      from demo_schema.transactions transactions_src_426
      where (
        (date_trunc('day', ds)) >= cast('1999-12-26' as timestamp)
      ) AND (
        (date_trunc('day', ds)) <= cast('2040-12-31' as timestamp)
      )
    ) subq_2
    on
      (
        subq_2.metric_time <= subq_1.metric_time
      ) and (
        subq_2.metric_time > dateadd(day, -7, subq_1.metric_time)
      )
  ) subq_3
)
group by
  metric_time,
limit 100;
```

## Limitations

If you specify a `window` in your cumulative metric definition, you must include `metric_time` as a dimension in the SQL query. This is because the accumulation window is based on metric time. For example,

```sql
select
  count(distinct subq_3.distinct_users) as weekly_active_users,
  subq_3.metric_time
from (
  select
    subq_2.distinct_users as distinct_users,
    subq_1.metric_time as metric_time
group by
  subq_3.metric_time
```
