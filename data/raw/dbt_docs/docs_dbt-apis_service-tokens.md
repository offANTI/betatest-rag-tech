# Service account tokens

dbt platform | Starter, Enterprise, Enterprise+

Service account tokens enable you to securely authenticate with the dbt API by assigning each token a narrow set of permissions that more precisely manages access to the API. While similar to [personal access tokens](./user-tokens.md), service account tokens belong to an account rather than a user.

You can use service account tokens for system-level integrations that do not run on behalf of any one user. Assign any permission sets available in dbt to your service account token, which can vary slightly depending on your plan:

* Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans can apply any permission sets available to service tokens.
* Developer and Starter plans can apply Semantic Layer permissions set to service tokens.
* Legacy Team plans can apply Account Admin, Member, Job Admin, Read-Only, Metadata, and Semantic Layer permissions set to service tokens.

You can assign as many permission sets as needed to one token. For more on permissions sets, see "[Enterprise Permissions](../platform/manage-access/enterprise-permissions.md)."

## Generate service account tokens

You can generate service tokens if you have a Developer [license](../platform/manage-access/seats-and-users.md) and account admin [permissions](../platform/manage-access/about-user-access.md#permission-sets). To create a service token in dbt, follow these steps:

1. From dbt, click on your account name in the left side menu and select **Account settings**.

2. On the left sidebar, click **Service Tokens**.

3. Click the **+ Create service token** button to generate a new token.

   1. Enter a name for your token.
   2. Add the necessary [permissions](./service-tokens.md#permissions-for-service-account-tokens).

4. Once the token is generated, you won't be able to view this token again so make sure to save it somewhere safe.

## Permissions for service account tokens

You can assign service account tokens to any permission set available in dbt. When you assign a permission set to a token, you will also be able to choose whether to grant those permissions to all projects in the account or to specific projects.

### Team plans using service account tokens

The following permissions can be assigned to a service account token on a Team plan. Refer to [Enterprise permissions](../platform/manage-access/enterprise-permissions.md) for more information about these roles.

* Billing Admin
* Job Admin
* Metadata Only
* Member
* Read-only
* Semantic Layer Only

## Service token update

On July 18, 2023, dbt Labs changed how tokens are generated and validated to increase performance. These improvements only apply to tokens created after July 18, 2023.

Old tokens remain valid, but if they are used in high-frequency API invocations, we recommend you rotate them for reduced latency.

To rotate your token:

1. Navigate to **Account settings** and click **Service tokens** on the left side pane.
2. Verify the **Created** date for the token is *on or before* July 18, 2023.
3. Click **+ New Token** on the top right side of the screen. Ensure the new token has the same permissions as the old one.
4. Copy the new token and replace the old one in your systems. Store it in a safe place, as it will not be available again once the creation screen is closed.
5. Delete the old token in dbt by clicking the **trash can icon**. *Only take this action after the new token is in place to avoid service disruptions*.

## FAQs

I'm receiving a 403 error 'Forbidden: Access denied' when using service tokens

All [service token](./service-tokens.md) traffic is subject to IP restrictions.

When using a service token, the following 403 response error indicates the IP is not on the allowlist. To resolve this, you should add your third-party integration CIDRs (network addresses) to your allowlist.

The following is an example of the 403 response error:

```json
        {
            "status": {
                "code": 403,
                "is_success": False,
                "user_message": ("Forbidden: Access denied"),
                "developer_message": None,
            },
            "data": {
                "account_id": <account_id>,
                "user_id": <user_id>,
                "is_service_token": <boolean describing if it's a service token request>,
                "account_access_denied": True,
            },
        }
```
