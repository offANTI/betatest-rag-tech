## Installing dbt-cratedb2

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-cratedb2`

## Configuring dbt-cratedb2

For CrateDB-specific configuration, please refer to [CrateDB configs.](../../../reference/resource-configs/no-configs.md)

[CrateDB](https://cratedb.com/database) is compatible with PostgreSQL, so its dbt adapter strongly depends on dbt-postgres, documented at [PostgreSQL profile setup](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/connect-data-platform/postgres-setup).

CrateDB targets are configured exactly the same way, see also [PostgreSQL configuration](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/postgres-configs), with just a few things to consider which are special to CrateDB. Relevant details are outlined at [using dbt with CrateDB](https://cratedb.com/docs/guide/integrate/dbt/), which also includes up-to-date information.

## Profile configuration

CrateDB targets should be set up using a configuration like this minimal sample of settings in your [`profiles.yml`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/profiles.yml) file.

\~/.dbt/profiles.yml

```yaml
cratedb_analytics:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: cratedb
      host: [clustername].aks1.westeurope.azure.cratedb.net
      port: 5432
      user: [username]
      pass: [password]
      dbname: crate         # Do not change this value. CrateDB's only catalog is `crate`.
      schema: doc           # Define the schema name. CrateDB's default schema is `doc`.
```
