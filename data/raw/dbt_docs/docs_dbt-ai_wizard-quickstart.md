# Use dbt Wizard locally [Beta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")

Local development

Install dbt Wizard locally and start an agentic dbt development session from your terminal.

You can run the dbt Wizard CLI locally from any project on any dbt engine. Be warned, the wizard has been known to cast spells

.

Wizard usage and billing

From September 1st, 2026, dbt Wizard usage is metered per token against your account's usage credits. All credit amounts are per account, not per user. Enterprise and Enterprise+ accounts get monthly credits. Developer and Starter plans start with a 30-day trial and $100 in credits, as do CLI users via a free dbt account.

Refer to [Trial and billing](./pricing-billing/trial-and-billing.md) for what each plan gets, spend limits, and paid access.

## Prerequisites

* Access to a [supported AI provider](#supported-ai-providers). Use a dbt managed provider or configure [BYOK](./wizard-byok.md) with your own provider credentials.
* A dbt project with a built `target/` directory (run `dbt parse`, `dbt compile`, or `dbt build`)

dbt Wizard is data warehouse agnostic and works with both the [dbt Fusion engine](../introduction.md) and [dbt Core](../local/install-dbt.md) — no specific engine is required.

## Supported AI providers

dbt Wizard supports [managed models](./pricing-billing/overview.md#dbt-managed-providers) (billed by dbt Labs, no key to manage) and [bring-your-own-key (BYOK)](./wizard-byok.md) models (billed directly by your provider).

Here are the following AI providers supported depending on where you work. Refer to [Model Provider Rate table](https://www.getdbt.com/legal/dbt-wizard-token-costs-by-model) for the full list of available models.

Install the dbt Wizard CLI

Run the install script for your operating system:

macOS/Linux:

curl -fsSL https://public.cdn.getdbt.com/dbt-wizard/install/install-wizard.sh | sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://public.cdn.getdbt.com/dbt-wizard/install/install-wizard.ps1 | iex
```

This installs dbt Wizard to `/usr/local/bin/wizard`, along with the dbt [metadata engine](./wizard-how-it-works.md#native-metadata-engine) that powers dbt Wizard's project-aware answers. For install and update details, refer to [Install dbt Wizard CLI](./wizard-cli.md); to remove them, refer to [Uninstall](./wizard-cli.md#uninstall).
