  outputs:
    dev:
      type: yellowbrick
      host: [hostname]
      user: [username]
      password: [password]
      port: [port]
      dbname: [database name]
      schema: [dbt schema]
      role: [optional, set the role dbt assumes when executing queries]
      sslmode: [optional, set the sslmode used to connect to the database]
      sslrootcert: [optional, set the sslrootcert config value to a new file path to customize the file location that contains root certificates]
  
```

### Configuration notes

This adapter is based on the dbt-postgres adapter documented here [Postgres profile setup](./postgres-setup.md)

#### role

The `role` config controls the user role that dbt assumes when opening new connections to the database.

#### sslmode / sslrootcert

The ssl config parameters control how dbt connects to Yellowbrick using SSL. Refer to the [Yellowbrick documentation](https://docs.yellowbrick.com/5.2.27/client_tools/config_ssl_for_clients_intro.html) for details.
