# dbt v2 readiness checklist

The dbt Fusion engine is here and is now generally available for dbt platform projects on Snowflake! We currently offer it as a [preview](../dbt-versions/product-lifecycles.md) for all other supported adapters. Even if we haven't enabled it for your account, you can still start preparing your projects for upgrade. Use this checklist to ensure a smooth upgrade once Fusion becomes available. If this is all new to you, first [learn about Fusion](../introduction.md), its current state, and the features available.

Enable the Fusion readiness panel

The Fusion readiness panel shows each project's eligibility status and blockers in the dbt platform. It's rolling out in phases — if it's not enabled for your account yet, an [account admin](../platform/manage-access/enterprise-permissions.md#account-admin) can turn it on in **Account settings** → **Account**. Refer to [Enable Fusion readiness features](../../guides/prepare-dbt-upgrade.md?step=2) for setup steps.

If you have access to dbt Wizard, use the [dbt Wizard's Fusion migration workflow](../dbt-ai/wizard-ide.md#fusion-migration-workflow) to help you fix compatibility errors directly from the Studio IDE using dbt Wizard — no manual log investigation needed!

## Preparing for Fusion

Use the following checklist to prepare your projects for the dbt Fusion engine

For walkthroughs of both the preparation and upgrade processes, check out our detailed guides:

* [ ] [Upgrade to Fusion Pt. 1: Preparing to upgrade](../../guides/prepare-dbt-upgrade.md?step=1)
* [ ] [Upgrade to Fusion Pt. 2: Making the move](../../guides/upgrade-to-dbt.md?step=1)

### Upgrade to the latest dbt version (recommended)

The **Latest** [release track](../dbt-versions/dbt-release-tracks.md) has all of the most recent features to help you prepare for Fusion.

* [ ] Make sure all your projects are on the **Latest** release track across all deployment environments and jobs. This is not a strict requirement for upgrading, but it will ensure the simplest, most predictable experience by allowing you to pre-validate that your project doesn't rely on deprecated behaviors.

### Resolve all deprecation warnings

You must resolve deprecations while your projects are on a dbt Core release track, as they result in warnings that will become errors once you upgrade to Fusion. The autofix tool can automatically resolve many deprecations (such as moving arbitrary configs into the meta dictionary). For a full list of deprecations and how to resolve them, refer to [Deprecations](../../reference/deprecations.md).

Start a new branch to begin resolving deprecation warnings using one of the following methods:

* [ ] **Run autofix in the dbt platform:** You can address deprecation warnings using the [autofix tool in the Studio IDE](../platform/studio-ide/autofix-deprecations.md). You can run the autofix tool on the **Compatible** or **Latest** release track.
* [ ] **Run autofix locally:** Use the [VS Code extension](../about-dbt-extension.md). The extension has a built-in ["Getting Started" workflow](../install-dbt-extension.md#getting-started) that will debug your dbt project in the VS Code or Cursor IDE and execute the autofix tool. This has the added benefit of installing Fusion to your computer so you can begin testing locally before implementing in your dbt platform account.
* [ ] **Run autofix locally (without the extension):** Visit the autofix [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-autofix) to run the tool locally if you're not using VS Code or Cursor. This will only run the tool, it will not install Fusion.
* [ ] **Remove behavior change flag overrides:** Fusion forcibly enables all behavior change flags. Remove any `flags:` overrides in your `dbt_project.yml` that opt out of these behaviors and validate that your project works correctly with them enabled.

### Upgrade YAML spec

* [ ] **Migrate Semantic Layer configs:** If your project uses the Semantic Layer, make sure your metric configurations use the [latest YAML spec](../build/latest-metrics-spec.md).

### Validate and upgrade your dbt packages

The most commonly used dbt Labs managed packages (such as `dbt_utils` and `dbt_project_evaluator`) are already compatible with Fusion, as are a large number of external and community packages. Review [the dbt package hub](https://hub.getdbt.com) to see verified Fusion-compatible packages by checking that the `require-dbt-version` configuration includes `2.0.0` or higher. Refer to [package support](./supported-features.md#package-support) for more information.

* [ ] Make sure that all of your packages are upgraded to the most recent version, many of which contain enhancements to support Fusion.
* [ ] Check package repositories to make sure they're compatible with Fusion. If a package you use is not yet compatible, we recommend opening an issue with the maintainer, making the contribution yourself, or removing the package temporarily before you upgrade.

### Validate user-defined functions

Check that Fusion supports all user-defined functions (UDFs) in your project.

Fusion supports nearly all built-in data platform functions out of the box. However, data platforms continuously add new functions that Fusion may not yet support.

If you see the error `dbt0209: No function <function name>`, you can resolve it depending on whether the function is a UDF or a built-in function:

* [ ] **For custom UDFs:** Recreate it as a [native dbt UDF](../build/udfs.md#defining-udfs-in-dbt) to get the full Fusion experience. With `static_analysis: baseline` (the default), most UDFs will work out of the box.
* [ ] **For Warehouse-native functions:** Submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion). Fusion's `baseline` mode handles most cases, but will throw warnings and not errors. You can set `static_analysis: off` for specific models if needed.

For more information about using `strict` in development and `baseline` in deployment, refer to [Optimize static analysis for development and deployment](../../best-practices/optimize-static-analysis-for-development-and-deployment.md).

### Check for known Fusion limitations

Your project may implement features that Fusion currently [limits](./supported-features.md#limitations) or doesn't support.

* [ ] Remove unnecessary features from your project to make it Fusion compatible.
* [ ] Monitor progress for critical features, knowing we are working to bring them to Fusion. You can monitor their progress using the issues linked in the [limitations table](./supported-features.md#limitations).

### Review jobs configured in the dbt platform

We determine Fusion eligibility using data from your job runs.

* [ ] Ensure you have at least one job running in each of your projects in the dbt platform.
  * [ ] Ensure each job has run within the last 7 days. Jobs that haven't run recently are considered inactive and are ineligible for Fusion. If you see a "no active jobs" ineligibility reason in the Fusion readiness UI, run the job manually or adjust its schedule.
* [ ] Ensure all jobs are running on the [**Latest** release track](../dbt-versions/dbt-release-tracks.md#which-release-tracks-are-available) for the smoothest upgrade experience.
* [ ] Resolve any job failures — all jobs must run successfully for eligibility checks to work.
* [ ] Delete any jobs that are no longer in use to ensure accurate eligibility reporting.
* [ ] Make sure you've promoted the changes for deprecation resolution and package upgrades to your git branches that map to your deployment environments.
* [ ] For eligible jobs, use **Debug on Fusion** to debug in Studio IDE or run once on Fusion. Refer to [Update your jobs](../../guides/prepare-dbt-upgrade.md?step=7).

### Stay informed about Fusion progress

The dbt Fusion engine is generally available for dbt platform projects on Snowflake and in preview for all other eligible projects! Keep up-to-date with these resources:

* [ ] Check out the [Fusion homepage](https://www.getdbt.com/product/fusion) for available resources, including supported adapters, prerequisites, installation instructions, limitations, and deprecations.
* [ ] Read the [Upgrade guide](../dbt-versions/dbt-upgrade/upgrading-to-v2.md) to learn about the new features and functionality that impact your dbt projects.
* [ ] Monitor progress and get insight into the development process by reading the [Fusion Diaries](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/discussions/categories/announcements?discussions_q=is:open+diaries+category:Announcements).
