## Roles in Starburst Enterprise

If connecting to a Starburst Enterprise cluster with built-in access controls enabled, you must specify a role using the format detailed in [Additional parameters](#additional-parameters). If a role is not specified, the default role for the provided username is used.

## Catalogs and schemas

When selecting the catalog and the schema, make sure the user has read and write access to both. This selection does not limit your ability to query the catalog. Instead, they serve as the default location for where tables and views are materialized. In addition, the Trino connector used in the catalog must support creating tables. This *default* can be changed later from within your dbt project.

## Configuration

To learn how to optimize performance with data platform-specific configurations in dbt, refer to [Starburst/Trino-specific configuration](../../../reference/resource-configs/trino-configs.md).
