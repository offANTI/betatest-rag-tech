## Installing dbt-synapse

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-synapse`

## Configuring dbt-synapse

For Synapse-specific configuration, please refer to [Synapse configs.](../../../reference/resource-configs/azuresynapse-configs.md)

Dedicated SQL only

Azure Synapse Analytics offers both dedicated SQL pools and serverless SQL pools. \*\*Only Dedicated SQL Pools are supported by this adapter.

### Prerequisites

On Debian/Ubuntu make sure you have the ODBC header files before installing

```bash
sudo apt install unixodbc-dev
```

Download and install the [Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15). If you already have ODBC Driver 17 installed, then that one will work as well.

Default settings change in dbt-synapse v1.2 / ODBC Driver 18

Microsoft made several changes related to connection encryption. Read more about the changes [here](./mssql-setup.md).

### Authentication methods

This adapter is based on the adapter for Microsoft SQL Server. Therefore, the same authentication methods are supported.

The configuration is the same except for 1 major difference: instead of specifying `type: sqlserver`, you specify `type: synapse`.

Example:

profiles.yml

```yaml
your_profile_name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: synapse
      driver: 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server' # (The ODBC Driver installed on your system)
      server: workspacename.sql.azuresynapse.net # (Dedicated SQL endpoint of your workspace here)
      port: 1433
      database: exampledb
      schema: schema_name
      user: username
      password: password
```

You can find all the available options and the documentation and how to configure them on [the documentation page for the dbt-sqlserver adapter](./mssql-setup.md).
