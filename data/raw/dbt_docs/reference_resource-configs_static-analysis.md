# static\_analysis

static\_analysis controls how the Fusion engine analyzes SQL at compile time for models, tests, seeds, and snapshots.

info

The `static_analysis` config is available in the dbt Fusion engine only. It isn't available in dbt Core and will be ignored. To upgrade to Fusion, refer to [Get started with Fusion](../../docs/dbt/get-started-dbt.md).

The `static_analysis` config sets how the dbt Fusion engine validates SQL before execution—using `strict` analysis, a `baseline` that balances checks with compatibility, or `off` to skip analysis when needed. You can find supported configuration locations for each resource type.

To check out which Snowflake functions are supported in Fusion in `strict` mode, refer to [Snowflake function support](./snowflake-function-support.md). For BigQuery, refer to [BigQuery function support](./bigquery-function-support.md).

## Definition

You can configure `static_analysis` for [models](../../docs/build/sql-models.md), [data tests](../../docs/build/data-tests.md), [seeds](../../docs/build/seeds.md), and [snapshots](../../docs/build/snapshots.md).

You can configure if and when the dbt Fusion engine performs static SQL analysis for a model. Configure the `static_analysis` config in your project YAML file (`dbt_project.yml`), model properties YAML file, or in a SQL config block in your model file. Refer to [Principles of static analysis](../../docs/build/about-static-analysis.md?version=1.12#principles-of-static-analysis) for more information on the different modes of static analysis.

Setting a model to `strict` does not automatically set `strict` for downstream models; they keep the project default unless you configure them explicitly. For more information and examples, refer to [strict mode inheritance](../../docs/build/about-static-analysis.md#strict-mode-inheritance).

The following values are available for `static_analysis`:

* `baseline` (default): Statically analyze SQL. This is the recommended starting point for users transitioning from dbt Core, providing a smooth migration experience while still catching most SQL errors. You can incrementally opt-in to stricter analysis over time.
* `strict` (previously `on`): Statically analyze all SQL before execution begins. Use this for maximum validation guarantees — nothing runs until the entire project is proven valid.
* `off`: Skip SQL analysis for this model and its descendants.

Deprecated values

The `on` and `unsafe` values are deprecated and will be removed in May 2026. Use `strict` instead.

### User-defined functions (UDFs) in `strict` mode

When `static_analysis: strict` is in effect, the dbt Fusion engine parses `CREATE FUNCTION` statements from [`sql_header`](./sql_header.md) and from [`on-run-start`](../project-configs/on-run-start-on-run-end.md) project hooks, registers those UDFs in the compiler registry, and makes them available during strict static compilation. The `baseline` and `off` modes don't perform this UDF registration for static analysis.

A model’s `sql_header` can include multiple statements. Fusion registers UDFs from `CREATE FUNCTION` statements and ignores other statements for this step.

If strict analysis still cannot resolve a UDF, set [`static_analysis: off`](./static-analysis.md#disable-static-analysis-in-sql-for-a-model-using-a-custom-udf) on the affected models.

### How static analysis modes cascade

Two rules determine how `static_analysis` modes apply in a lineage:

* Eligibility rule: A model is eligible for static analysis only if all of its "parents" are eligible (by parents, we mean the models that are upstream of the current model in the lineage).
* Strictness rule: A "child" model cannot be stricter than its parent (by child, we mean the models that are downstream of the current model in the lineage).

The static analysis configuration cascades from most strict to least strict. Here's the strictness hierarchy: `strict` → `baseline` → `off`

**Allowed downstream by parent mode**<br />When going downstream in your lineage, you can keep the same mode or relax it; but you cannot make a child stricter than its parent. The following table shows the allowed downstream modes by parent mode:

| Parent mode | Child can be                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `strict`    | `strict`, `baseline`, or `off`     |
| `baseline`  | `baseline` or `off` (not `strict`) |
| `off`       | `off` only                         |

For example, for the lineage Model A → Model B → Model C:

* If Model A is `baseline`, you *cannot* set Model B to `strict`
* If Model A is `strict`, you *can* set Model B to `baseline`

This makes sure that stricter validation requirements don't apply downstream when parent models haven't met those requirements. `baseline` doesn't produce the full analyzed schema that `strict` needs from its upstream models, so a downstream model of a `baseline` model can't run strict-level type checking.

Refer to the Fusion concepts page for deeper discussion and visuals: [New concepts](../../docs/build/about-static-analysis.md). For more info on the JSON schema, refer to the [dbt-jsonschema file](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-jsonschema/blob/1e2c1536fbdd421e49c8b65c51de619e3cd313ff/schemas/latest_fusion/dbt_project-latest-fusion.json#L4689).

### Custom materializations

The dbt Fusion engine automatically sets `static_analysis: off` for models built with a [custom materialization](../../guides/create-new-materializations.md). This applies whether you gave the materialization a new name or reused a built-in one, such as your own `table` or `incremental`.

A custom materialization can add, rename, or change the type of columns in the table it builds, and Fusion can't predict those changes before the model runs. It skips analysis for the same reason it skips [introspective queries](../../docs/build/about-static-analysis.md#introspection-handling-in-baseline-mode).

This means:

* Setting `strict` or `baseline` on a model that uses a custom materialization has no effect — the automatic downgrade to `off` takes precedence. The model doesn't error because of static analysis.
* Because `off` cascades, all models downstream of that model are also ineligible for static analysis, and features that depend on SQL comprehension (such as column-level lineage and type checking) aren't available for them.

To keep static analysis coverage across most of your DAG, use built-in materializations where practical, or keep custom materializations near the leaves (or ends) of your lineage. For example, use custom materializations on models that nothing else depends on so fewer downstream models lose static analysis coverage.

## CLI override

You can override model-level configuration for a run using the [`--static-analysis`](../global-configs/static-analysis-flag.md) flag. For example, to disable static analysis for a run:

```bash
dbt run --static-analysis off # disable static analysis for all models
dbt run --static-analysis baseline # use baseline analysis for all models
```

## Examples

The following examples show how to disable or configure `static_analysis` for different scenarios:

* [Enable strict analysis for all your models](#enable-strict-analysis-for-all-your-models)
* [Enable strict analysis for your models, not packages](#enable-strict-analysis-for-your-models-not-packages)
* [Disable static analysis for all models in a package](#disable-static-analysis-for-all-models-in-a-package)
* [Disable static analysis in YAML for a single model](#disable-static-analysis-in-yaml-for-a-single-model)
* [Disable static analysis in SQL for a model using a custom UDF](#disable-static-analysis-in-sql-for-a-model-using-a-custom-udf)
* [Configure static analysis for tests](#configure-static-analysis-for-tests)
* [Configure static analysis for seeds](#configure-static-analysis-for-seeds)
* [Configure static analysis for snapshots](#configure-static-analysis-for-snapshots)

#### Enable strict analysis for all your models

The recommended way to get maximum SQL validation for your entire project is to set `strict` in the top-level `models` configuration in your `dbt_project.yml`. This configuration applies strict analysis to every model in your project, so you don't need to configure each model individually:

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
name: jaffle_shop

models:
  jaffle_shop:
    +static_analysis: strict
    staging:
      +materialized: view
    marts:
      +materialized: table
```

You can set individual subdirectories or models to `baseline` or `off` where needed (for example, models that use unsupported UDFs). Individual models can use less strict settings than the project-level config, but you can't set them to stricter settings. The project default is `baseline`.

In this example, strict static analysis applies only to Jaffle Shop models. Installed packages keep the default `baseline` setting unless you explicitly configure them.

#### Disable static analysis for all models in a package

This example shows how to disable static analysis for all models in a package. The [`+` prefix](./plus-prefix.md) applies the config to all models in the package.

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
name: jaffle_shop

models:
  jaffle_shop:
    marts:
      +materialized: table

  a_package_with_introspective_queries:
    +static_analysis: off
```

#### Disable static analysis in YAML for a single model

This example shows how to disable static analysis for a single model in YAML.

models/my\_udf\_using\_model.yml

```yml
models:
  - name: model_with_static_analysis_off
    config:
      static_analysis: off
```

#### Disable static analysis in SQL for a model using a custom UDF

This example shows how to disable static analysis for a model using a custom [user-defined function (UDF)](../../docs/build/udfs.md) in a SQL file.

models/my\_udf\_using\_model.sql

```sql
{{ config(static_analysis='off') }}

select
  user_id,
  my_cool_udf(ip_address) as cleaned_ip
from {{ ref('my_model') }}
```

#### Configure static analysis for data tests

This example shows how to set static analysis for all tests in a project using `dbt_project.yml`.

dbt\_project.yml

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
data_tests:
  +static_analysis: baseline
```

To configure static analysis for a specific data test on a model:

models/filename.yml

```yaml
# models/filename.yml
models:
  - name: my_model
    data_tests:
      - not_null:
          arguments:
            column_name: order_id
          config:
            static_analysis: off
```

#### Configure static analysis for seeds

This example shows how to set static analysis for all seeds in a project.

dbt\_project.yml

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
seeds:
  your_project:
    +static_analysis: baseline
```

To configure a single seed in a properties file:

seeds/filename.yml

```yaml
# seeds/filename.yml
seeds:
  - name: my_seed
    config:
      static_analysis: off
```

#### Configure static analysis for snapshots

This example shows how to set static analysis for all snapshots in a project.

dbt\_project.yml

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
snapshots:
  your_project:
    +static_analysis: baseline
```

To configure a single snapshot in a properties file:

snapshots/filename.yml

```yaml
# snapshots/filename.yml
snapshots:
  - name: my_snapshot
    config:
      static_analysis: off
```

## Considerations

* For models, disabling static analysis means that features of the VS Code extension that depend on SQL comprehension will be unavailable.
* For models, static analysis can fail in some cases (for example, dynamic SQL constructs or unrecognized UDFs) and you might need to set `static_analysis: off`. For more examples, refer to [When should I turn static analysis off?](../../docs/build/about-static-analysis.md#when-should-i-turn-static-analysis-off).
* Models that use a [custom materialization](#custom-materializations) are automatically set to `off`, so the mode you configure isn't always the mode in effect. To check the effective mode for a model, use the CodeLens in the dbt VS Code extension or the Studio IDE, which shows which models have static analysis disabled and why.
