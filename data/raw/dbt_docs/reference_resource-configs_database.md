# database

### Model

Specify a custom database for a model in your `dbt_project.yml` file.

For example, if you have a model that you want to load into a database other than the target database, you can configure it like this:

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
models:
  your_project:
    sales_metrics:
      +database: reporting
```

This would result in the generated relation being located in the `reporting` database, so the full relation name would be `reporting.finance.sales_metrics` instead of the default target database.

### Seeds

Configure a database in your `dbt_project.yml` file.

For example, to load a seed into a database called `staging` instead of the target database, you can configure it like this:

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
seeds:
  your_project:
    product_categories:
      +database: staging
```

This would result in the generated relation being located in the `staging` database, so the full relation name would be `staging.finance.product_categories`.

### Snapshots

(Applies to dbt v1.9 and later)

Specify a custom database for a snapshot in your `dbt_project.yml`, snapshot.yml file, or config file.

For example, if you have a snapshot that you want to load into a database other than the target database, you can configure it like this:

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
snapshots:
  your_project:
    your_snapshot:
      +database: snapshots
```

Or in a `snapshot_name.yml` file:

snapshots/snapshot\_name.yml

```yaml

snapshots:
  - name: snapshot_name
    config:
      database: snapshots
```

This results in the generated relation being located in the `snapshots` database so the full relation name would be `snapshots.finance.your_snapshot` instead of the default target database.

### Tests

Customize the database for storing test results in your `dbt_project.yml` file.

For example, to save test results in a specific database, you can configure it like this:

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
data_tests:
  +store_failures: true
  +database: test_results
```

This would result in the test results being stored in the `test_results` database.

## Definition

Optionally specify a custom database for a [model](../../docs/build/sql-models.md), [seed](../../docs/build/seeds.md), [snapshot](../../docs/build/snapshots.md), or [data test](../../docs/build/data-tests.md).

When dbt creates a relation (table/view) in a database, it creates it as: `{{ database }}.{{ schema }}.{{ identifier }}`, e.g. `analytics.finance.payments`

The standard behavior of dbt is:

* If a custom database is *not* specified, the database of the relation is the target database (`{{ target.database }}`).
* If a custom database is specified, the database of the relation is the `{{ database }}` value.

To learn more about changing the way that dbt generates a relation's `database`, read [Using Custom Databases](../../docs/build/custom-databases.md)

## Warehouse specific information

* BigQuery: `project` and `database` are interchangeable
* Databricks: `catalog` and `database` are interchangable
