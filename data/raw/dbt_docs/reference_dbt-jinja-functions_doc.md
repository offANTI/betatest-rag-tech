# About the doc function

You can specify documentation text in a docs block, then use the `doc()` Jinja function in description fields as a way to reuse the same text in multiple places. You can only use the `doc()` Jinja function in properties YAML files for resources with description properties. For example, models, model columns, sources, source tables, source columns, and so on.

The `doc()` Jinja function, which is analogous to `ref()`, looks up the named docs block (for example, `{% docs orders %} ... {% enddocs %}` in a `docs.md` file) and returns its rendered content. For more information, refer to the [Documentation guide](../../docs/explore/build-and-view-your-docs.md).

## Usage

In dbt, column descriptions can be defined directly in a model's properties YAML file. These descriptions are written as plain text and are associated with a specific column.

### Manually adding descriptions

models/orders.yml

```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: order_total_cents
        description: "Total order amount in cents. This value is always a positive integer and excludes taxes and shipping."
```

When you run `dbt docs generate` and view the docs site, this text appears exactly as written but only for the `order_total_cents` column of the `orders` model.

### Reusing descriptions with doc()

To avoid repeating the same description across multiple models or columns, dbt lets you define documentation separately and reference it using the `doc()` function.

With this approach, documentation is written once in a markdown file using a named docs block, and then reused wherever needed in your project. This helps ensure consistency and makes it easier to maintain shared definitions over time.

First, define a reusable documentation block in a `docs.md`:

models/docs/example.md

```text
{% docs order_total_cents %}
Total order amount in cents. This value is always a positive integer and excludes taxes and shipping.
{% enddocs %}
```

This defines a docs block named `order_total_cents`. Reference it with `doc('order_total_cents')` in description fields wherever you need the same text.

Next, reference this documentation in your properties YAML file:

models/orders.yml

```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: order_total_cents
        description: "{{ doc('order_total_cents') }}"
```

When you run `dbt docs generate`, dbt resolves the `doc()` reference by looking up the corresponding docs block and injecting its content into the generated documentation.

As a result, the column description displays the text defined in the markdown file, rather than inline YAML.

## Avoid duplicate names

Docs block names must be unique within your project. If you define multiple `{% docs %}` blocks with the same name, dbt cannot reliably determine which block to use when `doc('DOCS_BLOCK_NAME')` is called.

(Applies to dbt v2.0 and later)

In the dbt Fusion engine, duplicate docs block names are not allowed. If duplicates are found, dbt reports the conflicting files and surfaces a warning. Rename one block so each docs block name is unique. For more information, refer to [Stricter evaluation of duplicate docs blocks](../../docs/dbt-versions/dbt-upgrade/upgrading-to-v2.md?version=2.0#stricter-evaluation-of-duplicate-docs-blocks).

models/docs/example.md

```text
{% docs order_total_cents %}
Total order amount in cents. This value is always a positive integer and excludes taxes and shipping.
{% enddocs %}
 
{% docs order_total_cents %}
Total order amount in cents, excluding taxes and shipping fees.
{% enddocs %}
```

```text
dbt found two docs with the same name: 'order_total_cents' in files: 'models/docs/example.md' and 'models/docs/example.md'
```
