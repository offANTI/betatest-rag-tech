# on\_configuration\_change

info

This functionality is currently only supported for [materialized views](../../docs/build/materializations.md#materialized-view) on a subset of adapters.

The `on_configuration_change` config has three settings:

* `apply` (default) — Attempt to update the existing database object if possible, avoiding a complete rebuild.
  * *Note:* If any individual configuration change requires a full refresh, a full refresh is performed in lieu of individual alter statements.
* `continue` — Allow runs to continue while also providing a warning that the object was left untouched.
  * *Note:* This could result in downstream failures as those models may depend on these unimplemented changes.
* `fail` — Force the entire run to fail if a change is detected.

### Project YAML file

dbt\_project.yml

```yaml
models:
  <resource-path>:
    +materialized: <materialization_name>
    +on_configuration_change: apply | continue | fail
```

### Properties YAML file

models/properties.yml

```yaml

models:
  - name: [<model-name>]
    config:
      materialized: <materialization_name>
      on_configuration_change: apply | continue | fail
```

### SQL file config

models/\<model\_name>.sql

```jinja
{{ config(
    materialized="<materialization_name>",
    on_configuration_change="apply" | "continue" | "fail"
) }}
```

## Creation precedence

Materializations are implemented following this "drop through" life cycle:

1. If a model does not exist with the provided path, create the new model.
2. If a model exists, but has a different type, drop the existing model and create the new model.
3. If [`--full-refresh`](./full_refresh.md) is supplied, replace the existing model regardless of configuration changes and the [`on_configuration_change`](./on_configuration_change.md) setting.
   * BigQuery users may need to run `dbt run --full-refresh` (instead of `dbt run`) after changing a model’s materialization (for example, from `table` to `view`) to ensure dbt fully replaces the existing relation and the change is fully applied.
4. If there are no configuration changes, perform the default action for that type (e.g. apply refresh for a materialized view).
5. Determine whether to apply the configuration changes according to the `on_configuration_change` setting.
