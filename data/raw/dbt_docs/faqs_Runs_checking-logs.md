# How can I see the SQL that dbt is running?

To check out the SQL that dbt is running, you can look in:

* dbt:
  * Within the run output, click on a model name, and then select "Details"

* dbt Core:

  * The `target/compiled/` directory for compiled `select` statements
  * The `target/run/` directory for compiled `create` statements
  * The `logs/dbt.log` file for verbose logging.
