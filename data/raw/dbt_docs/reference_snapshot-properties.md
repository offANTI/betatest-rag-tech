# Snapshot properties

Define snapshot properties in YAML to document snapshots, configure settings, add tests, and describe columns.

(Applies to dbt v1.9 and later)

In dbt v1.9 and later, snapshots are defined and configured in YAML files within your `snapshots/` directory (as defined by the [`snapshot-paths` config](./project-configs/snapshot-paths.md)). Snapshot properties are declared within these YAML files, allowing you to define both the snapshot configurations and properties in one place.

We recommend that you put them in the `snapshots/` directory. You can name these files `whatever_you_want.yml`, and nest them arbitrarily deeply in subfolders within the `snapshots/` or `models/` directory.
