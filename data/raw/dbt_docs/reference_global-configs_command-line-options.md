# Command line options

For consistency, command-line interface (CLI) flags should come right after the `dbt` prefix and its subcommands. This includes "global" flags (supported for all commands). For the full list of global CLI options for dbt Core or the dbt Fusion engine (depending on your [selected docs version](../../docs/dbt-versions.md)), refer to [Available flags](./about-global-configs.md#available-flags). When set, CLI flags override [environment variables](./environment-variable-configs.md) and [project flags](./project-flags.md).

For example, instead of using:

```bash
dbt --no-populate-cache run
```

You should use:

```bash
dbt run --no-populate-cache
```

Historically, passing flags (such as "global flags") *before* the subcommand is a legacy functionality that dbt Labs can remove at any time. We do not support using the same flag before and after the subcommand.

## Using boolean and non-boolean flags

You can construct your commands with boolean flags to enable or disable or with non-boolean flags that use specific values, such as strings.

### Non-boolean config

Use this non-boolean config structure:

* Replacing `<SUBCOMMAND>` with the command this config applies to.
* `<THIS-CONFIG>` with the config you are enabling or disabling, and
* `<SETTING>` with the new setting for the config.

CLI flags

```text

<SUBCOMMAND> --<THIS-CONFIG>=<SETTING> 
```

### Example

CLI flags

```text

dbt run --printer-width=80 
dbt test --indirect-selection=eager
```

### Boolean config

To enable or disable boolean configs:

* Use `<SUBCOMMAND>` this config applies to.
* Followed by `--<THIS-CONFIG>` to turn it on, or `--no-<THIS-CONFIG>` to turn it off.
* Replace `<THIS-CONFIG>` with the config you are enabling or disabling

CLI flags

```text
dbt <SUBCOMMAND> --<THIS-CONFIG> 
dbt <SUBCOMMAND> --no-<THIS-CONFIG> 
```

### Example

CLI flags

```text

dbt run --version-check
dbt run --no-version-check 
```

## Config precedence

There are multiple ways of setting flags, which depend on the use case:

* **[CLI options](./command-line-options.md):** Define behavior specific to *this invocation*. Supported for all dbt commands.
* **[Environment variables](./environment-variable-configs.md):** Define different behavior in different runtime environments (development vs. production vs. [continuous integration](../../docs/deploy/continuous-integration.md)), or different behavior for different users in development (based on personal preferences).
* **[Project-level `flags` in `dbt_project.yml`](./project-flags.md):** Define version-controlled defaults for everyone running this project. Also, opt in or out of [behavior changes](./behavior-changes.md) to manage your migration off legacy functionality.
* **[User settings (`~/.dbt/user_settings.yml`)](./user-settings.md):** Define personal preferences that apply across all projects on your machine. Written automatically by `dbt login`.

The most specific setting "wins." CLI options take the highest precedence, followed by environment variables, then `dbt_project.yml`, and finally `user_settings.yml`. If you set the flag in none of those places, it will use the default value defined within dbt.

Most flags can be set in all three places:

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
flags:
  # set default for running this project -- anywhere, anytime, by anyone
  fail_fast: true
```

(Applies to dbt v1.11 and later)

```bash
# set this environment variable to 'True' (bash syntax)
export DBT_ENGINE_FAIL_FAST=1
dbt run
```

```bash
dbt run --fail-fast # set to True for this specific invocation
dbt run --no-fail-fast # set to False
```

There are two categories of exceptions:

1. **Flags setting file paths:** Flags for file paths that are relevant to runtime execution (for example, `--log-path` or `--state`) cannot be set in `dbt_project.yml`. To override defaults, pass CLI options or set environment variables ((Applies to dbt v1.11 and later) `DBT_ENGINE_LOG_PATH` and `DBT_ENGINE_STATE`). Flags that tell dbt where to find project resources (for example, `model-paths`) are set in `dbt_project.yml`, but as a top-level key, outside the `flags` dictionary; these configs are expected to be fully static and never vary based on the command or execution environment.
2. **Opt-in flags:** Flags opting in or out of [behavior changes](./behavior-changes.md) can *only* be defined in `dbt_project.yml`. These are intended to be set in version control and migrated via pull/merge request. Their values should not diverge indefinitely across invocations, environments, or users.
